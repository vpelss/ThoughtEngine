# ThoughtEngine

Thought Engine allows you to take properly formatted text, and feed a unique thought/sentence from the text to your visitors based days since epoch date.

It can be used as a thought of the day script!

The Thought Engine script also allows you to easily modify how the text is displayed simply by editing an HTML file.

The Thought Engine script was originally written for the Bible (Bibliomancy), but it can use any text as long as it is formatted properly.
