1|2|al-Fatihah: The Opening|Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, 
1|3|al-Fatihah: The Opening|The Beneficent, the Merciful. 
1|4|al-Fatihah: The Opening|Master of the Day of Judgment, 
1|5|al-Fatihah: The Opening|Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help. 
1|6|al-Fatihah: The Opening|Show us the straight path, 
1|7|al-Fatihah: The Opening|The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who  earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray. 
2|1|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Alif. Lam. Mim. 
2|2|al-Baqarah: The Cow|This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who  ward off (evil). 
2|3|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We  have bestowed upon them; 
2|4|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that  which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter. 
2|5|al-Baqarah: The Cow|These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful. 
2|6|al-Baqarah: The Cow|As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is  all one for them; they believe not. 
2|7|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a  covering. Theirs will be an awful doom. 
2|8|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day,  when they believe not. 
2|9|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none  save themselves; but they perceive not. 
2|10|al-Baqarah: The Cow|In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful  doom is theirs because they lie. 
2|11|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We  are peacemakers only. 
2|12|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Are not they indeed the mischief-makers ? But they perceive not. 
2|13|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall  we believe as the foolish believe ? are not they indeed the foolish ? But they know  not. 
2|14|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but  when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but  mock. 
2|15|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their  contumacy. 
2|16|al-Baqarah: The Cow|These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their  commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided. 
2|17|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it  sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in  darkness, where they cannot see, 
2|18|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not. 
2|19|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash  of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for  fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience  and His omnipotence). 
2|20|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it  flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they  stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is  able to do all things. 
2|21|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you,  so that ye may ward off (evil). 
2|22|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy;  and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for  you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know (better). 
2|23|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave  (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside  Allah if ye are truthful. 
2|24|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against  the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones. 
2|25|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good  works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are  regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime;  and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for  ever  they abide. 
2|26|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who  believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What  doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude ? He misleadeth many thereby, and He  guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants; 
2|27|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that  which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: Those are  they who are the losers. 
2|28|al-Baqarah: The Cow|How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you!  Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return. 
2|29|al-Baqarah: The Cow|He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the  heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things. 
2|30|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in  the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will  shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee ? He said: Surely I  know that which ye know not. 
2|31|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying:  Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful. 
2|32|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast  taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise. 
2|33|al-Baqarah: The Cow|He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed  them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens  and the earth ? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide. 
2|34|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they  fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever. 
2|35|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye  freely (of the fruits) thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest ye become  wrong-doers. 
2|36|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the  (happy) state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the  other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time. 
2|37|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He relented  toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful. 
2|38|al-Baqarah: The Cow|We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you  from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come  upon them neither shall they grieve. 
2|39|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples  of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
2|40|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and  fulfil your (part of the) covenant, I shall fulfil My (part of the) covenant, and fear Me. 
2|41|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already  (of the Scripture), and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My  revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me. 
2|42|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth. 
2|43|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who  bow (in worship). 
2|44|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget (to  practise it) ? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense ? 
2|45|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humble- minded, 
2|46|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are  returning. 
2|47|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and  how I preferred you to (all) creatures. 
2|48|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another,  nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it,  nor will they be helped. 
2|49|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were  afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women: that  was a tremendous trial from your Lord. 
2|50|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned  the folk of Pharaoh in your sight. 
2|51|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights (of solitude), and then ye  chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers. 
2|52|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks. 
2|53|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion (of right and  wrong), that ye might be led aright. 
2|54|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged  yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in penitence to your  Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator  and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. 
2|55|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah  plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you. 
2|56|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks. 
2|57|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you  the manna and the quails, (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have  provided you - they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves. 
2|58|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is  therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance." We will forgive you your  sins and will increase (reward) for the right-doers. 
2|59|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for  another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their  evil-doing. 
2|60|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy  staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe  knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do  not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth. 
2|61|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon  thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs  and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye  exchange that which is higher for that which is lower ? Go down to settled country,  thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were  stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because  they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for  their disobedience and transgression. 
2|62|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad),  and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah  and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there  shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
2|63|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And (remember, O Children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you  and caused the mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which We have  given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil). 
2|64|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of  Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers. 
2|65|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto  them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! 
2|66|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and  an admonition to the God-fearing. 
2|67|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye  sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us ? He answered: Allah forbid  that I should be among the foolish! 
2|68|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she  is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor  immature; (she is) between the two conditions; so do that which ye are commanded. 
2|69|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour  she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is her  colour, gladdening beholders. 
2|70|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she  is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright. 
2|71|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth  not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou  bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not. 
2|72|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And (remember) when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah  brought forth that which ye were hiding. 
2|73|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life  and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand. 
2|74|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks, or  worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush,  and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And  indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of  what ye do. 
2|75|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to  listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it,  knowingly ? 
2|76|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But  when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah  hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it  ? Have ye then no sense ? 
2|77|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and  that which they proclaim ? 
2|78|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from  hearsay. They but guess. 
2|79|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and  then say, "This is from Allah," that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe  unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn  thereby. 
2|80|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And they say: The Fire  (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain  number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will not  break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ? 
2|81|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are  rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. 
2|82|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the  Garden. They will abide therein. 
2|83|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel,  (saying): Worship none save Allah (only), and be good to parents and to kindred and  to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and  pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse. 
2|84|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of  your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified  (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto). 
2|85|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from  their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression ? - and if  they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was  itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part  thereof ? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the  world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous  doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 
2|86|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter.  Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support. 
2|87|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of  messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of  Allah's sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that,  when there cometh unto you a messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves  desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay ? 
2|88|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for  their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. 
2|89|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in  their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those  who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the  truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers. 
2|90|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that  which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto  whom He will of His slaves.  They have incurred anger upon anger.  For disbelievers  is a shameful doom. 
2|91|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed,  they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that  which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say  (unto them, O Muhammad): Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye  are (indeed) believers ? 
2|92|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), yet,  while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were wrong-doers. 
2|93|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower  above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our  Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink  into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is  that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers. 
2|94|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is  indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye pretend), then long for  death (for ye must long for death) if ye are truthful. 
2|95|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have  sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 
2|96|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier) than the  idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And  to live (a thousand years) would be no means remove him from the doom. Allah is  Seer of what they do. 
2|97|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is  who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by Allah's leave, confirming that which  was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers; 
2|98|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel  and Michael! Then, lo! Allah (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers. 
2|99|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will  disbelieve in them. 
2|100|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside ?  The truth is, most of them believe not. 
2|101|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that  which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the  Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not, 
2|102|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of  Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind  magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor  did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a  temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two  (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but  they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth  them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein  will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which  they sell their souls, if they but knew. 
2|103|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would  be better, if they only knew. 
2|104|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): "Listen to us" but say "Look  upon us," and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom. 
2|105|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the  idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your  Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite  Bounty. 
2|106|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be  forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that  Allah is Able to do all things ? 
2|107|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of  the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any guardian or helper ? 
2|108|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime ?  He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain  road. 
2|109|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your  belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto  them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is  Able to do all things. 
2|110|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send  before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
2|111|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.  These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful. 
2|112|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his  reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they  grieve. 
2|113|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the Christians say  the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak  those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection  concerning that wherein they differ. 
2|114|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the  sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their  ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear.  Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom. 
2|115|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is  Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
2|116|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but  whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him. 
2|117|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He  saith unto it only: Be! and it is. 
2|118|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us,  or some sign come unto us ? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those (who were)  before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people  who are sure. 
2|119|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad  tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire. 
2|120|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou  follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah (Himself) is Guidance. And if thou  shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then  wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper. 
2|121|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right  reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the  losers. 
2|122|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and  how I preferred you to (all) creatures. 
2|123|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And guard (yourselves) against a day when no soul will in aught avail  another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of use to  it; nor will they be helped. 
2|124|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he  fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind. (Abraham)  said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders) ? He said: My covenant includeth  not wrong-doers. 
2|125|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and  sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to  pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, (saying): Purify My  house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow  down and prostrate themselves (in worship). 
2|126|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and  bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He  answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a while,  then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end! 
2|127|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House,  (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us (this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art  the Hearer, the Knower. 
2|128|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation  submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo!  Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful. 
2|129|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who  shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in  wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise. 
2|130|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself  ? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the  righteous. 
2|131|al-Baqarah: The Cow|When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the  Lord of the Worlds. 
2|132|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, (saying): O my  sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore die not save as men  who have surrendered (unto Him). 
2|133|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons:  What will ye worship after me ? They said: We shall worship thy God, the God of thy  fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One God, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
2|134|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned,  and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 
2|135|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say  (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the  upright, and he was not of the idolaters. 
2|136|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and  that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the  tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received  from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
2|137|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they rightly  guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and Allah will suffice thee (for  defence) against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
2|138|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(We take our) colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring.  We are His worshippers. 
2|139|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Say (unto the People of the Scripture): Dispute ye with us concerning Allah  when He is our Lord and your Lord ? Ours are our works and yours your works. We  look to Him alone. 
2|140|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes  were Jews or Christians ? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah ? And who is more  unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah ? Allah is  not unaware of what ye do. 
2|141|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned  and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 
2|142|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah  which they formerly observed ? Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He  guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 
2|143|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses  against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We  appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who  followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard  (test) save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith  should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind. 
2|144|al-Baqarah: The Cow|We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O  Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah  which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye  (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces (when ye pray) toward it. Lo!  Those who have received the Scripture know that (this revelation) is the Truth from  their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. 
2|145|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all  kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a follower of  their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou  shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then  surely wert thou of the evil-doers. 
2|146|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as they  recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal the truth. 
2|147|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those who  waver. 
2|148|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one another in  good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all together. Lo! Allah is  Able to do all things. 
2|149|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And whencesoever thou comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy  face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord. Allah  is not unaware of what ye do. 
2|150|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of  Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it (when ye  pray) so that men may have no argument against you, save such of them as do  injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon  you, and that ye may be guided. 
2|151|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who reciteth  unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth you the Scripture and  wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not. 
2|152|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and reject  not Me. 
2|153|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is with  the steadfast. 
2|154|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah "dead." Nay, they are  living, only ye perceive not. 
2|155|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of  wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the steadfast, 
2|156|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah's and lo! unto  Him we are returning. 
2|157|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such are  the rightly guided. 
2|158|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of  Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House (of God) or  visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his  own accord, (for him) lo! Allah is Responsive, Aware. 
2|159|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after  We had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah and  accursed of those who have the power to curse. 
2|160|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth). These it  is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful. 
2|161|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on them is the  curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. 
2|162|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them, neither  will they be reprieved. 
2|163|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Your God is One God; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent, the  Merciful. 
2|164|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of night  and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and  the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its  death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and (in) the ordinance of the winds,  and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty)  for people who have sense. 
2|165|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship  which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that which is the due)  of Allah (only) - those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah - Oh, that  those who do evil had but known, (on the day) when they behold the doom, that  power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment! 
2|166|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed  (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them. 
2|167|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us,  we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them  their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire. 
2|168|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and  follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 
2|169|al-Baqarah: The Cow|He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell  concerning Allah that which ye know not. 
2|170|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they  say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers  were wholly unintelligent  and had no guidance ? 
2|171|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The likeness of those who disbelieve (in relation to the messenger) is as the  likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry.  Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense. 
2|172|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you,  and render thanks to Allah if it is (indeed) He Whom ye worship. 
2|173|al-Baqarah: The Cow|He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that  which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than Allah. But he who is  driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah  is Forgiving, Merciful. 
2|174|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed  and  purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. Allah  will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow.  Theirs will be a painful doom. 
2|175|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at  the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire! 
2|176|al-Baqarah: The Cow|That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those  who find (a cause of) disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism. 
2|177|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but  righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the  Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to  orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free;  and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who keep their  treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of  stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God-fearing. 
2|178|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the  murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for  the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his (injured) brother,  prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an  alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a  painful doom. 
2|179|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye may  ward off (evil). 
2|180|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave  wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. (This is) a duty  for all those who ward off (evil). 
2|181|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only  upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
2|182|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and maketh  peace between the parties, (it shall be) no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
2|183|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for  those before you, that ye may ward off (evil); 
2|184|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(Fast) a certain number of days; and (for) him who is sick among you, or on  a journey, (the same) number of other days; and for those who can afford it there is a  ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso doeth good of his own accord, it is  better for him: and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know - 
2|185|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for  mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion (of right and wrong).  And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is  sick or on a journey, (let him fast the same) number of other days. Allah desireth for  you ease; He desireth not hardship for you; and (He desireth) that ye should complete  the period, and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that  peradventure ye may be thankful. 
2|186|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am nigh. I  answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So let them hear My call  and let them trust in Me, in order that they may be led aright. 
2|187|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast.  They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were  deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and  relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained  for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the  black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them  not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah,  so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they  may ward off (evil). 
2|188|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to  gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the property  of others wrongfully. 
2|189|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They ask thee, (O Muhammad), of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons  for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the  backs thereof (as do the idolaters at certain seasons), but the righteous man is he who  wardeth off (evil). So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to  Allah, that ye may be successful. 
2|190|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not  hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. 
2|191|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places  whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not  with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if  they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 
2|192|al-Baqarah: The Cow|But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
2|193|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if  they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers. 
2|194|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in  retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked you.  Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off (evil). 
2|195|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands  to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent. 
2|196|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Perform the pilgrimage and the visit (to Makka) for Allah. And if ye are  prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and shave not your  heads until the gifts have reached their destination. And whoever among you is sick  or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering.  And if ye are in safety, then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the  pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts as can be had with ease. And whosoever cannot find  (such gifts), then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage, and of seven when ye  have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for him whoso folk are not present at the  Inviolable Place of Worship. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is  severe in punishment. 
2|197|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The pilgrimage is (in) the well-known months, and whoever is minded to  perform the pilgrimage therein (let him remember that) there is (to be) no lewdness  nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And whatsoever good ye do  Allah knoweth it. So  make provision for yourselves (Hereafter); for the best  provision is to ward off evil. Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of  understanding. 
2|198|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading). But,  when ye press on in the multitude from 'Arafat, remember Allah by the sacred  monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before ye were of those  astray. 
2|199|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward,  and ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
2|200|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye  remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind is he who  saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world," and he hath no portion in the Hereafter. 
2|201|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And of them (also) is he who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world that  which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and guard us from the doom of  Fire." 
2|202|al-Baqarah: The Cow|For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have  earned. Allah is swift at reckoning. 
2|203|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth (his  departure) by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is no sin for him;  that is for him who wardeth off (evil). Be careful of your duty to Allah, and know that  unto Him ye will be gathered. 
2|204|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world  pleaseth thee (Muhammad), and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is in his  heart; yet he is the most rigid of opponents. 
2|205|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when he turneth away (from thee) his effort in the land is to make  mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not mischief. 
2|206|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride taketh  him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place. 
2|207|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah;  and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen. 
2|208|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission (unto Him); and follow  not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 
2|209|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then know  that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
2|210|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the  shadows of the clouds with the angels ? Then the case would be already judged. All  cases go back to Allah (for judgment). 
2|211|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them! He  who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him (for him), lo! Allah is  severe in punishment. 
2|212|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a jest  of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the  Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will. 
2|213|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Mankind were one community, and Allah sent (unto them) prophets as  bearers of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the Scripture with the  truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed. And  only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it, after clear  proofs had come unto them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His Will  guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed. Allah  guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 
2|214|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you  the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before you ? Affliction and  adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till the messenger (of  Allah) and those who believed along with him said: When cometh Allah's help ? Now  surely Allah's help is nigh. 
2|215|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They ask thee, (O Muhammad), what they shall spend. Say: that which ye  spend for good (must go) to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and  the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is Aware of it. 
2|216|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen  that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing  which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not. 
2|217|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred  month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way  of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to  expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing.  And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades  from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his  disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter.  Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein. 
2|218|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate (to escape the persecution)  and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's mercy. Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
2|219|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is  great sin, and (some) utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their  usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to spend. Say: that which is  superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you (His) revelations, that haply ye may  reflect. 
2|220|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning  orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs,  then (they are) your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who  improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty,  Wise. 
2|221|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman is  better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your daughters in  marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a believing slave is better than an  idolater though he please you. These invite unto the Fire, and Allah inviteth unto the  Garden, and unto forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His revelations to  mankind that haply they may remember. 
2|222|al-Baqarah: The Cow|They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is an  illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are  cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah  hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth  those who have a care for cleanness. 
2|223|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will,  and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye  will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O Muhammad). 
2|224|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being righteous and  observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind. Allah is Hearer,  Knower. 
2|225|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional  in your oaths.  But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered. Allah is  Forgiving, Clement. 
2|226|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they change  their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
2|227|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if they decide upon divorce (let them remember that) Allah is Hearer,  Knower. 
2|228|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three  (monthly) courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which  Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And  their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a  reconciliation. And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in  kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
2|229|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Divorce must be pronounced twice and then (a woman) must be retained in  honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women  aught of that which ye have given them; except (in the case) when both fear that they  may not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. And if ye fear that they  may not be able to keep the limits of Allah, in that case it is no sin for either of them  if the woman ransom herself. These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Transgress  them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits: such are wrong-doers. 
2|230|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if he hath divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him  thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he (the other husband)  divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider  that they are able to observe the limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah. He  manifesteth them for people who have knowledge. 
2|231|al-Baqarah: The Cow|When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then retain  them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to their hurt so that ye  transgress (the limits). He who doeth that hath wronged his soul. Make not the  revelations of Allah a laughing-stock (by your behaviour), but remember Allah's  grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of  wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know that  Allah is Aware of all things. 
2|232|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not  difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in  kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah and the  Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye know not. 
2|233|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those  who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers  in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child. No-one should be charged beyond  his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child, nor should  he to whom the child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the  (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If  they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, it is no sin  for them; and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide  that ye pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know  that Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
2|234|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait,  keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term  (prescribed for them) then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with  themselves in decency. Allah is informed of what ye do. 
2|235|al-Baqarah: The Cow|There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds  concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will remember them. But  plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words. And  do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run. Know that Allah  knoweth what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving,  Clement. 
2|236|al-Baqarah: The Cow|It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them,  nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means,  and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty  for those who do good. 
2|237|al-Baqarah: The Cow|If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto  them a portion, then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed, unless they (the  women) agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie.  To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer  of what ye do. 
2|238|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with  devotion to Allah. 
2|239|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if ye go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback. And when ye are  again in safety, remember Allah, as He hath taught you that which (heretofore) ye  knew not. 
2|240|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(In the case of) those of you who are about to die and leave behind them  wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning  them out, but if they go out (of their own accord) there is no sin for you in that which  they do of themselves within their rights. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
2|241|al-Baqarah: The Cow|For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off  (evil). 
2|242|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand. 
2|243|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their  habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die; and then  He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most  of mankind give not thanks. 
2|244|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
2|245|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may give it  increase manifold ? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye will return. 
2|246|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they  said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah's  way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you  ? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been driven from  our dwellings with our children ? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they  turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 
2|247|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king for  you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of  the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given wealth enough ? He said: Lo!  Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and  stature. Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing,  All-Knowing. 
2|248|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is that there  shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your Lord, and a  remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left behind, the  angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be a token for you if (in truth) ye are believers. 
2|249|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by (the  ordeal of) a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me, and  whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of  his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the  river), he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day  against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah  exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah's  leave! Allah is with the steadfast. 
2|250|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said:  Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and give us help against  the disbelieving folk. 
2|251|al-Baqarah: The Cow|So they routed them by Allah's leave and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave  him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He willeth. And if Allah  had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah  is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures. 
2|252|al-Baqarah: The Cow|These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad) with  truth, and lo! thou art of the number of (Our) messengers; 
2|253|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of  whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He exalted (above  others) in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) and We supported him with the holy Spirit. And if Allah had so wiled it,  those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear  proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some  disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with  another; but Allah doeth what He will. 
2|254|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day  come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession. The  disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers. 
2|255|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor  sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave ?  He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they  encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the  heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime,  the Tremendous. 
2|256|al-Baqarah: The Cow|There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct  from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a  firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
2|257|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth them out  of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false deities.  They bring them out of light into darkness. Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They  will abide therein. 
2|258|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord,  because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He  Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham  said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from  the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
2|259|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which had  fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its  death ? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He  said: How long hast thou tarried ? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a  day. (He) said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food  and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a  token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with  flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah  is Able to do all things. 
2|260|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And when Abraham said (unto his Lord): My Lord! Show me how Thou  givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe ? Abraham said: Yea, but (I ask)  in order that my heart may be at ease. (His Lord) said: Take four of the birds and  cause them to incline unto thee, then place a part of them on each hill, then call them,  they will come to thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
2|261|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is as the likeness  of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains. Allah giveth  increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
2|262|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not  reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with their  Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve. 
2|263|al-Baqarah: The Cow|A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury.  Allah is Absolute, Clement. 
2|264|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury,  like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in Allah  and the Last Day. His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth; a  rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare. They have no control of aught of that  which they have gained. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
2|265|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's  pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a  height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the  rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
2|266|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers  flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age hath stricken  him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is (all)  consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you, in order that ye  may give thought. 
2|267|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and of  that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad (with intent) to  spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain;  and know that Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
2|268|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness. But  Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is All-Embracing,  All-knowing. 
2|269|al-Baqarah: The Cow|He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given,  he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of  understanding. 
2|270|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it. Wrong-doers  have no helpers. 
2|271|al-Baqarah: The Cow|If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give it to the  poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of your ill-deeds. Allah is  Informed of what ye do. 
2|272|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad), but Allah guideth  whom He will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves, when ye  spend not save in search of Allah's Countenance; and whatsoever good thing ye  spend, it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. 
2|273|al-Baqarah: The Cow|(Alms are) for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who cannot  travel in the land (for trade). The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of  their restraint. Thou shalt know them by their mark: They do not beg of men with  importunity. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah knoweth it. 
2|274|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly, verily  their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall  they grieve. 
2|275|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil  hath prostrated by (his) touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like usury;  whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an admonition  from his Lord cometh, and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto), he shall keep (the  profits of) that which is past, and his affair (henceforth) is with Allah. As for him who  returneth (to usury) - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
2|276|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth not the  impious and guilty. 
2|277|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the  poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them  neither shall they grieve. 
2|278|al-Baqarah: The Cow|O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth  (due to you) from usury, if ye are (in truth) believers. 
2|279|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if ye do not, then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His  messenger. And if ye repent, then ye have your principal (without interest). Wrong  not, and ye shall not be wronged. 
2|280|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be)  postponement to (the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be  better for you if ye did but know. 
2|281|al-Baqarah: The Cow|And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to  Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned, and they will not  be wronged. 002.282 
2|283|al-Baqarah: The Cow|If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand (shall  suffice). And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that  which is entrusted to him (according to the pact between them) and let him observe  his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who hideth it, verily his heart is  sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do. 
2|284|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Unto Allah (belongeth) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth; and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will bring  you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and He will punish whom He  will. Allah is Able to do all things. 
2|285|al-Baqarah: The Cow|The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his  Lord and (so do) believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His  scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His  messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. (Grant us) Thy forgiveness, our  Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying. 
2|286|al-Baqarah: The Cow|Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope. For it (is only) that which it hath  earned, and against it (only) that which it hath deserved. Our Lord! Condemn us not if  we forget, or miss the mark! Our Lord! Lay not on us such a burden as thou didst lay  on those before us! Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength  to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on us, Thou, our Protector, and give us  victory over the disbelieving folk. 
3|1|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Alim. Lam. Mim. 
3|2|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. 
3|3|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming  that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel. 
3|4|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion (of  right and wrong). Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, theirs will be a  heavy doom. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong). 
3|5|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah. 
3|6|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth Him. There is no God  save Him, the Almighty, the Wise. 
3|7|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture wherein are  clear revelations - they are the substance of the Book - and others (which are)  allegorical. But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is  allegorical seeking (to cause) dissension by seeking to explain it. None knoweth its  explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We believe  therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed. 
3|8|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou hast guided us, and  bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Bestower. 
3|9|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! Lo! it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which  there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. 
3|10|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(On that Day) neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve will  aught avail them with Allah. They will be fuel for Fire. 
3|11|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Like Pharaoh's folk and those who were before them, they disbelieved Our  revelations and so Allah seized them for their sins. And Allah is severe in  punishment. 
3|12|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say (O Muhammad) unto those who disbelieve: Ye shall be overcome and  gathered unto Hell, an evil resting-place. 
3|13|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the  way of Allah, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number,  clearly, with their very eyes. Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He  will. Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes. 
3|14|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Beautified for mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and  offspring; and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and horses branded (with their  mark), and cattle and land. That is comfort of the life of the world. Allah! With Him  is a more excellent abode. 
3|15|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: Shall I inform you of something better than that ? For those who keep  from evil, with their Lord, are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they  will abide, and pure companions, and contentment from Allah. Allah is Seer of His  bondmen, 
3|16|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those who say: Our Lord! Lo! we believe. So forgive us our sins and guard  us from the punishment of Fire; 
3|17|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|The steadfast, and the truthful, and the obedient, those who spend (and hoard  not), those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night. 
3|18|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah (Himself) is Witness that there is no God save Him. And the angels  and the men of learning (too are witness). Maintaining His creation in justice, there is  no God save Him the Almighty, the Wise. 
3|19|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! religion with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His Will and Guidance). Those  who (formerly) received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them,  through transgression among themselves. Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah  (will find that) lo! Allah is swift at reckoning. 
3|20|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my  purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have  received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered ? If they  surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty  only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen. 
3|21|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slay the prophets  wrongfully, and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity: promise them a painful  doom. 
3|22|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those are they whose works have failed in the world and the Hereafter; and  they have no helpers. 
3|23|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Hast thou not seen how those who have received a portion of the Scripture  invoke the Scripture of Allah (in their disputes) that it may judge between them; then  a faction of them turn away, being opposed (to it) ? 
3|24|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|That is because they say: The Fire will not touch us save for a certain number  of days. That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion. 
3|25|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|How (will it be with them) when We have brought them all together to a Day  of which there is no doubt, when every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned,  and they will not be wronged. 
3|26|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: O Allah! Owner of Sovereignty! Thou givest sovereignty unto whom  Thou wilt, and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt. Thou exaltest  whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt. In Thy hand is the good. Lo!  Thou art Able to do all things. 
3|27|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Thou causest the night to pass into the day, and Thou causest the day to pass  into the night. And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead, and Thou bringest  forth the dead from the living. And Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou choosest,  without stint. 
3|28|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to  believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless (it be) that ye but  guard yourselves against them, taking (as it were) security. Allah biddeth you beware  (only) of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying. 
3|29|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say, (O Muhammad): Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or reveal  it, Allah knoweth it. He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the  earth, and Allah is Able to do all things. 
3|30|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|On the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath  done of good and all that it hath done of evil (every soul) will long that there might be  a mighty space of distance between it and that (evil). Allah biddeth you beware of  Him. And Allah is Full of Pity for (His) bondmen. 
3|31|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say, (O Muhammad, to mankind): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will  love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
3|32|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: Obey Allah and the messenger. But if they turn away, lo! Allah loveth  not the disbelievers (in His guidance). 
3|33|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and the Family of Abraham and the  Family of 'Imran above (all His) creatures. 
3|34|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
3|35|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto  Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo!  Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! 
3|36|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a  female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female;  and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her  offspring from Satan the outcast. 
3|37|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a  goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the  sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said: O Mary! Whence  cometh unto thee this (food) ? She answered: It is from Allah. Allah giveth without  stint to whom He will. 
3|38|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Then Zachariah prayed unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow upon me of  Thy bounty goodly offspring. Lo! Thou art the Hearer of Prayer. 
3|39|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: Allah  giveth thee glad tidings of (a son whose name is) John, (who cometh) to confirm a  word from Allah lordly, chaste, a prophet of the righteous. 
3|40|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when age hath overtaken me  already and my wife is barren ? (The angel) answered: So (it will be). Allah doeth  what He will. 
3|41|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He said: My Lord! Appoint a token for me. (The angel) said: The token unto  thee (shall be) that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by signs.  Remember thy Lord much, and praise (Him) in the early hours of night and morning. 
3|42|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee and made  thee pure, and hath preferred thee above (all) the women of creation. 
3|43|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord, prostrate thyself and bow with those who  bow (in worship). 
3|44|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|This is of the tidings of things hidden. We reveal it unto thee (Muhammad).  Thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens (to know) which of them  should be the guardian of Mary, nor wast thou present with them when they  quarrelled (thereupon). 
3|45|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(And remember) when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah giveth thee glad  tidings of a word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary,  illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (unto Allah). 
3|46|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of  the righteous. 
3|47|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|She said: My Lord! How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me  ? He said: So (it will be). Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing, He saith  unto it only: Be! and it is. 
3|48|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the  Gospel, 
3|49|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying): Lo! I  come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the  likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him  who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I  announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily  is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers. 
3|50|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to  make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign  from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
3|51|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path. 
3|52|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|But when Jesus became conscious of their disbelief, he cried: Who will be  my helpers in the cause of Allah ? The disciples said: We will be Allah's helpers. We  believe in Allah, and bear thou witness that we have surrendered (unto Him). 
3|53|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him  whom Thou hast sent. Enrol us among those who witness (to the truth). 
3|54|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and  Allah is the best of schemers. 
3|55|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(And remember) when Allah said: O Jesus! Lo! I am gathering thee and  causing thee to ascend unto Me, and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve and  am setting those who follow thee above those who disbelieve until the Day of  Resurrection. Then unto Me ye will (all) return, and I shall judge between you as to  that wherein ye used to differ. 
3|56|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement  in the world and the Hereafter; and they will have no helpers. 
3|57|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their  wages in full. Allah loveth not wrong-doers. 
3|58|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|This (which) We recite unto thee is a revelation and a wise reminder. 
3|59|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created  him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is. 
3|60|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(This is) the truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those  who waver. 
3|61|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which  hath come unto thee, say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons,  and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray  humbly (to our Lord) and (solemnly) invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie. 
3|62|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! This verily is the true narrative. There is no God save Allah, and lo!  Allah, He verily is, is the Mighty, the Wise. 
3|63|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And if they turn away, then lo! Allah is Aware of (who are) the corrupters. 
3|64|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you:  that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him,  and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah. And if they turn away,  then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). 
3|65|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the  Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him ? Have ye then no sense ? 
3|66|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge:  Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge ? Allah knoweth.  Ye know not. 
3|67|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who  had surrendered (to Allah), and he was not of the idolaters. 
3|68|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham are those who  followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe (with him); and Allah is the  Protecting Guardian of the believers. 
3|69|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|A party of the People of the Scripture long to make you go astray; and they  make none to go astray except themselves, but they perceive not. 
3|70|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah,  when ye (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth) ? 
3|71|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood and  knowingly conceal the truth ? 
3|72|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And a party of the People of the Scripture say: Believe in that which hath  been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day, and disbelieve at the  end thereof, in order that they may return; 
3|73|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And believe not save in one who followeth your religion - Say (O  Muhammad): Lo! the guidance is Allah's Guidance - that anyone is given the like of  that which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of  their Lord. Say (O Muhammad): Lo! the bounty is in Allah's hand. He bestoweth it on  whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
3|74|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|He selecteth for His mercy whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
3|75|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a  weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if thou  trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over  him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles. They speak a lie  concerning Allah knowingly. 
3|76|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Nay, but (the chosen of Allah is) he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth off  (evil); for lo! Allah loveth those who ward off (evil). 
3|77|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their  oaths, they have no portion in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them nor look  upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a  painful doom. 
3|78|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And lo! there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues,  that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the  Scripture. And they say: It is from Allah, when it is not from Allah; and they speak a  lie concerning Allah knowingly. 
3|79|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is not (possible) for any human being unto whom Allah had given the  Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto  mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but (what he said was): Be ye faithful  servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture and of your  constant study thereof. 
3|80|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets  for lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered (to Allah) ? 
3|81|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|When Allah made (His) covenant with the prophets, (He said): Behold that  which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will  come unto you a messenger, confirming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in  him and ye shall help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden  (which I lay upon you) in this (matter) ? They answered: We agree. He said: Then  bear ye witness. I will be a witness with you. 
3|82|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Then whosoever after this shall turn away: they will be miscreants. 
3|83|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Seek they other than the religion of Allah, when unto Him submitteth  whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him  they will be returned. 
3|84|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say (O Muhammad): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us  and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the  tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the prophets from  their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
3|85|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender (to Allah) it will not  be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter. 
3|86|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and (after)  they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
3|87|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|As for such, their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of Allah and of  angels and of men combined. 
3|88|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They will abide therein. Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they  be reprieved; 
3|89|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Save those who afterward repent and do right. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
3|90|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief, and afterward  grow violent in disbelief: their repentance will not be accepted. And such are those  who are astray. 
3|91|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those who disbelieve, and die in disbelief, the (whole) earth full of gold  would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom (for his soul).  Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers. 
3|92|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love. And  whatsoever ye spend, Allah is Aware thereof. 
3|93|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel, save that which Israel  forbade himself, (in days) before the Torah was revealed. Say: Produce the Torah and  read it (unto us) if ye are truthful. 
3|94|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that concerning Allah, such will  be wrong-doers. 
3|95|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: Allah speaketh truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright. He  was not of the idolaters. 
3|96|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Becca, a blessed  place, a guidance to the peoples; 
3|97|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Wherein are plain memorials (of Allah's guidance); the place where  Abraham stood up to pray; and whosoever entereth it is safe. And pilgrimage to the  House is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for  him who disbelieveth, (let him know that) lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures. 
3|98|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of  Allah, when Allah (Himself) is Witness of what ye do ? 
3|99|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers from the way of  Allah, seeking to make it crooked, when ye are witnesses (to Allah's guidance) ?  Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 
3|100|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the  Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief. 
3|101|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|How can ye disbelieve, when it is ye unto whom Allah's revelations are  recited, and His messenger is in your midst ? He who holdeth fast to Allah, he indeed  is guided unto a right path. 
3|102|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah with right observance, and die  not save as those who have surrendered (unto Him) 
3|103|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of Allah, and do not separate.  And remember Allah's favour unto you: How ye were enemies and He made  friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace; and (how)  ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it. Thus Allah  maketh clear His revelations unto you, that haply ye may be guided, 
3|104|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and enjoin  right conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who are successful. 
3|105|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had  come unto them. For such there is an awful doom, 
3|106|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|On the Day when (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be  blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto  them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief ? Then taste the punishment for  that ye disbelieved. 
3|107|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And as for those whose faces have been whitened, in the mercy of Allah they  dwell for ever. 
3|108|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|These are revelations of Allah. We recite them unto thee in truth. Allah  willeth no injustice to (His) creatures. 
3|109|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth; and unto Allah all things are returned. 
3|110|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin  right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah. And if the People of the  Scripture had believed it had been better for them. Some of them are believers; but  most of them are evil-livers. 
3|111|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against you they  will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped. 
3|112|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save (where they  grasp) a rope from Allah and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from their  Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve the  revelations of Allah, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is because they were  rebellious and used to transgress. 
3|113|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch  community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season, falling prostrate  (before Him). 
3|114|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin right conduct and forbid  indecency, and vie one with another in good works. These are of the righteous. 
3|115|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And whatever good they do, they will not be denied the meed thereof. Allah  is Aware of those who ward off (evil). 
3|116|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them  aught against Allah; and such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
3|117|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the  likeness of a biting, icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have  wronged themselves, and devastateth it. Allah wronged them not, but they do wrong  themselves. 
3|118|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who  would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you. Hatred is revealed by (the  utterance of) their mouths, but that which their breasts hide is greater. We have made  plain for you the revelations if ye will understand. 
3|119|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! ye are those who love them though they love you not, and ye believe in  all the Scripture. When they fall in with you they say: We believe; but when they go  apart they bite their finger-tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! Allah is  Aware of what is hidden in (your) breasts. 
3|120|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|If a lucky chance befall you, it is evil unto them, and if disaster strike you  they rejoice thereat. But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm  you. Lo! Allah is Surrounding what they do. 
3|121|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to the  believers their positions for the battle, Allah was Hearer, Knower. 
3|122|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|When two parties of you almost fell away, and Allah was their Protecting  Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust. 
3|123|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah had already given you the victory at Badr, when ye were contemptible.  So observe your duty to Allah in order that ye may be thankful. 
3|124|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|When thou didst say unto the believers: Is it not sufficient for you that your  Lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down (to your help) ? 
3|125|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Nay, but if ye persevere, and keep from evil, and (the enemy) attack you  suddenly, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on. 
3|126|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah ordained this only as a message of good cheer for you, and that thereby  your hearts might be at rest - Victory cometh only from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise - 
3|127|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or overwhelm them so  that they retire, frustrated. 
3|128|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad) whether He relent toward them or  punish them; for they are evil-doers. 
3|129|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth. He forgiveth whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
3|130|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling (the sum  lent). Observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful. 
3|131|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And ward off (from yourselves) the Fire prepared for disbelievers. 
3|132|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And obey Allah and the messenger, that ye may find mercy. 
3|133|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a paradise  as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who ward off (evil); 
3|134|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those who spend (of that which Allah hath given them) in ease and in  adversity, those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind; Allah  loveth the good; 
3|135|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And those who, when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves, remember  Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins - Who forgiveth sins save Allah only ? -  and will not knowingly repeat (the wrong) they did. 
3|136|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|The reward of such will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever - a bountiful reward  for workers! 
3|137|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Systems have passed away before you. Do but travel in the land and see the  nature of the consequence for those who did deny (the messengers). 
3|138|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|This is a declaration for mankind, a guidance and an admonition unto those  who ward off (evil) 
3|139|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Faint not nor grieve, for ye will overcome them if ye are (indeed) believers. 
3|140|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|If ye have received a blow, the (disbelieving) people have received a blow  the like thereof. These are (only) the vicissitudes which We cause to follow one  another for mankind, to the end that Allah may know those who believe and may  choose witnesses from among you; and Allah loveth not wrong-doers. 
3|141|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And that Allah may prove those who believe, and may blight the  disbelievers. 
3|142|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet Allah knoweth not  those of you who really strive, nor knoweth those (of you) who are steadfast ? 
3|143|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it (in the field). Now ye  have seen it with your eyes! 
3|144|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed  away before him. Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain, ye will turn back on your  heels ? He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to Allah, and Allah will reward  the thankful. 
3|145|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|No soul can ever die except by Allah's leave and at a term appointed. Whoso  desireth the reward of the world, We bestow on him thereof; and whoso desireth the  reward of the Hereafter, We bestow on him thereof. We shall reward the thankful. 
3|146|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men  who fought (beside him). They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of  Allah, nor did they weaken, nor were they brought low. Allah loveth the steadfast. 
3|147|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Their cry was only that they said: Our Lord! forgive us for our sins and  wasted efforts, make our foothold sure, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk. 
3|148|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|So Allah gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the  Hereafter. Allah loveth those whose deeds are good. 
3|149|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! if ye obey those who disbelieve, they will make you turn  back on your heels, and ye turn back as losers. 
3|150|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers. 
3|151|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they  ascribe unto Allah partners, for which no warrant hath been revealed. Their habitation  is the Fire, and hapless the abode of the wrong-doers. 
3|152|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah verily made good His promise unto you when ye routed them by His  leave, until (the moment) when your courage failed you, and ye disagreed about the  order and ye disobeyed, after He had shown you that for which ye long. Some of you  desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter. Therefore He made you flee  from them, that He might try you. Yet now He hath forgiven you. Allah is a Lord of  Kindness to believers. 
3|153|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|When ye climbed (the hill) and paid no heed to anyone, while the messenger,  in your rear, was calling you (to fight). Therefor He rewarded you grief for (his) grief,  that (He might teach) you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed or for that  which befell you. Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
3|154|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Then, after grief, He sent down security for you. As slumber did it overcome  a party of you, while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account,  thought wrongly of Allah, the thought of ignorance. They said: Have we any part in  the cause ? Say (O Muhammad): The cause belongeth wholly to Allah. They hide  within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto thee, saying: Had we had  any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say: Even though ye had  been in your houses, those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places  where they were to lie. (All this hath been) in order that Allah might try what is in  your breasts and prove what is in your hearts. Allah is Aware of what is hidden in the  breasts (of men). 
3|155|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met, Satan  alone it was who caused them to backslide, because of some of that which they have  earned. Now Allah hath forgiven them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Clement. 
3|156|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren  who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field: If they had been (here) with  us they would not have died or been killed: that Allah may make it anguish in their  hearts. Allah giveth life and causeth death; and Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
3|157|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And what though ye be slain in Allah's way or die therein ? Surely pardon  from Allah and mercy are better than all that they amass. 
3|158|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|What though ye be slain or die, when unto Allah ye are gathered ? 
3|159|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It was by the mercy of Allah that thou wast lenient with them (O  Muhammad), for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have  dispersed from round about thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and  consult with them upon the conduct of affairs. And when thou art resolved, then put  thy trust in Allah. Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust (in Him). 
3|160|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|If Allah is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraw His help  from you, who is there who can help you after Him ? In Allah let believers put their  trust. 
3|161|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is not for any prophet to embezzle. Whoso embezzleth will bring what he  embezzled with him on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full  what it hath earned; and they will not be wronged. 
3|162|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Is one who followeth the pleasure of Allah as one who hath earned  condemnation from Allah, whose habitation is the Fire, a hapless journey's end ? 
3|163|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|There are degrees (of grace and reprobation) with Allah, and Allah is Seer of  what they do. 
3|164|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Allah verily hath shown grace to the believers by sending unto them a  messenger of their own who reciteth unto them His revelations, and causeth them to  grow, and teacheth them the Scripture and wisdom; although before (he came to  them) they were in flagrant error. 
3|165|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And was it so, when a disaster smote you, though ye had smitten (them with  a disaster) twice (as great), that ye said: How is this ? Say (unto them, O  Muhammad): It is from yourselves. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 
3|166|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|That which befell you, on the day when the two armies met, was by  permission of Allah; that He might know the true believers; 
3|167|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight  in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of  fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith. They  utter with their mouths a thing  which is not in their hearts. Allah is Best Aware of  what they hide. 
3|168|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those who, while they sat at home, said of their brethren (who were fighting  for the cause of Allah): If they had been guided by us they would not have been slain.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful. 
3|169|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead. Nay, they are  living. With their Lord they have provision. 
3|170|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Jubilant (are they) because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of  His bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left  behind: That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
3|171|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|They rejoice because of favour from Allah and kindness, and that Allah  wasteth not the wage of the believers. 
3|172|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|As for those who heard the call of Allah and His messenger after the harm  befell them (in the fight); for such of them as do right and ward off (evil), there is  great reward. 
3|173|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those unto whom men said: Lo! the people have gathered against you,  therefor fear them. (The threat of danger) but increased the faith of them and they  cried: Allah is Sufficient for us! Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust! 
3|174|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|So they returned with grace and favour from Allah, and no harm touched  them. They followed the good pleasure of Allah, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
3|175|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is only the devil who would make (men) fear his partisans. Fear them not;  fear Me, if ye are true believers. 
3|176|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they  injure Allah not at all. It is Allah's Will to assign them no portion in the Hereafter, and  theirs will be an awful doom. 
3|177|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm Allah not at all, but  theirs will be a painful doom. 
3|178|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth  good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness. And  theirs will be a shameful doom. 
3|179|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is not (the purpose) of Allah to leave you in your present state till He shall  separate the wicked from the good. And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you  know the Unseen. But Allah chooseth of His messengers whom He will, (to receive  knowledge thereof). So believe in Allah and His messengers. If ye believe and ward  off (evil), yours will be a vast reward. 
3|180|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And let not those who hoard up that which Allah hath bestowed upon them  of His bounty think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That which  they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's is the heritage of  the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
3|181|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Verily Allah heard the saying of those who said, (when asked for  contributions to the war): "Allah, forsooth, is poor, and we are rich!" We shall record  their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall say: Taste ye  the punishment of burning! 
3|182|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before (you to the  judgment). Allah is no oppressor of (His) bondmen. 
3|183|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|(The same are) those who say: Lo! Allah hath charged us that we believe not  in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Messengers came unto you before me with miracles,  and with that (very miracle) which ye describe. Why then did ye slay them ? (Answer  that) if ye are truthful! 
3|184|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And if they deny thee, even so did they deny messengers who were before  thee, who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving light. 
3|185|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Every soul will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of  Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned. Whoso is removed from the Fire  and is made to enter paradise, he indeed is triumphant. The life of this world is but  comfort of illusion. 
3|186|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye will  hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the  idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off (evil), then that is of the steadfast heart of  things. 
3|187|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the  Scripture (He said): Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung  it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they  have gained thereby. 
3|188|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Think not that those who exult in what they have given, and love to be  praised for what they have not done - Think not, they are in safety from the doom. A  painful doom is theirs. 
3|189|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Allah is  Able to do all things. 
3|190|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and (in) the difference of  night and day are tokens (of His Sovereignty) for men of understanding, 
3|191|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Such as remember Allah, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the  creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say): Our Lord! Thou createdst not this in  vain. Glory be to Thee! Preserve us from the doom of Fire. 
3|192|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast  confounded. For evil-doers there will be no helpers. 
3|193|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: "Believe ye in your  Lord!" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefor forgive us our sins, and remit from us our  evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. 
3|194|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Our Lord! And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy  messengers. Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Thou breakest not  the tryst. 
3|195|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And their Lord hath heard them (and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of  any worker, male or female, to be lost. Ye proceed one from another. So those who  fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My cause, and  fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily I shall  bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow - A reward from Allah. And  with Allah is the fairest of rewards. 
3|196|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|Let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelieve, in the land,  deceive thee (O Muhammad). 
3|197|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|It is but a brief comfort. And afterward their habitation will be hell, an ill  abode. 
3|198|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens underneath  which rivers flow, wherein they will be safe for ever. A gift of welcome from their  Lord. That which Allah hath in store is better for the righteous. 
3|199|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah  and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them, humbling  themselves before Allah. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the  revelations of Allah. Verily their reward is with their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift to take  account. 
3|200|Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran|O ye who believe! Endure, outdo all others in endurance, be ready, and  observe your duty to Allah, in order that ye may succeed. 
4|1|an-Nisa': Women|O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a  single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a  multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward Allah in Whom ye  claim (your rights) of one another, and toward the wombs (that bare you). Lo! Allah  hath been a watcher over you. 
4|2|an-Nisa': Women|Give unto orphans their wealth. Exchange not the good for the bad (in your  management thereof) nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth. Lo! that would be  a great sin. 
4|3|an-Nisa': Women|And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the  women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do  justice (to so many) then one (only) or (the captives) that your right hands possess.  Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice. 
4|4|an-Nisa': Women|And give unto the women (whom ye marry) free gift of their marriage  portions; but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof, then ye are  welcome to absorb it (in your wealth). 
4|5|an-Nisa': Women|Give not unto the foolish (what is in) your (keeping of their) wealth, which  Allah hath given you to maintain; but feed and clothe them from it, and speak kindly  unto them. 
4|6|an-Nisa': Women|Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of  sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by  squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso (of the guardians) is rich,  let him abstain generously (from taking of the property of orphans); and whoso is  poor let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship). And when ye deliver up  their fortune unto orphans, have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence. Allah  sufficeth as a Reckoner. 
4|7|an-Nisa': Women|Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which parents and near  kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred  leave, whether it be little or much - a legal share. 
4|8|an-Nisa': Women|And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division (of  the heritage), bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them. 
4|9|an-Nisa': Women|And let those fear (in their behaviour toward orphans) who if they left behind  them weak offspring would be afraid for them. So let them mind their duty to Allah,  and speak justly. 
4|10|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, they do but  swallow fire into their bellies, and they will be exposed to burning flame. 
4|11|an-Nisa': Women|Allah chargeth you concerning (the provision for) your children: to the male  the equivalent of the portion of two females, and if there be women more than two,  then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one (only) then the half.  And to each of his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a son; and if he have  no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third; and if  he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may  have bequeathed, or debt (hath been paid). Your parents and your children: Ye know  not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an injunction from Allah. Lo!  Allah is Knower, Wise. 
4|12|an-Nisa': Women|And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave, if they have  no child; but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave,  afte r any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt (they ma y have contracted, hath  been paid). And unto them belon geth the fourth of that which ye leave if ye have no  ch ild, but if ye have a child then the eighth of that whi ch ye leave, after any legacy  ye may have bequeathed, o r debt (ye may have contracted, hath been paid). And if  a  man or a woman have a distant heir (having left neit her parent nor child), and he (or  she) have a brother o r a sister (only on the mother's side) then to each of them twain  (the brother and the sister) the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be  sharers in  the third, after any legacy that may have been bequeat hed or debt  (contracted) not injuring (the heirs by wil ling away more than a third of the heritage)  hath been 
4|13|an-Nisa': Women|These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Whoso obeyeth Allah and His  messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where  such will dwell for ever. That will be the great success. 
4|14|an-Nisa': Women|And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger and transgresseth His limits,  He will make him enter Fire, where he will dwell for ever; his will be a shameful  doom. 
4|15|an-Nisa': Women|As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four  of you against them. And if they testify (to the truth of the allegation) then confine  them to the houses until death take them or (until) Allah appoint for them a way  (through new legislation). 
4|16|an-Nisa': Women|And as for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both. And if  they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo! Allah is ever relenting, Merciful. 
4|17|an-Nisa': Women|Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah toward those who do evil in  ignorance (and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah. These are they toward  whom Allah relenteth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 
4|18|an-Nisa': Women|The forgiveness is not for those who do ill-deeds until, when death attendeth  upon one of them, he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who die while they are  disbelievers. For such We have prepared a painful doom. 
4|19|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women (of  your deceased kinsmen), nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them that ye may  take away a part of that which ye have given them, unless they be guilty of flagrant  lewdness. But consort with them in kindness, for if ye hate them it may happen that  ye hate a thing wherein Allah hath placed much good. 
4|20|an-Nisa': Women|And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one  of them a sum of money (however great), take nothing from it. Would ye take it by  the way of calumny and open wrong ? 
4|21|an-Nisa': Women|How can ye take it (back) after one of you hath gone in unto the other, and  they have taken a strong pledge from you ? 
4|22|an-Nisa': Women|And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what hath  already happened (of that nature) in the past. Lo! it was ever lewdness and  abomination, and an evil way. 
4|23|an-Nisa': Women|Forbidden unto you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters,  and your father's sisters, and your mother's sisters, and your brother's daughters and  your sister's daughters, and your foster-mothers, and your foster-sisters, and your  mothers-in-law, and your step-daughters who are under your protection (born) of your  women unto whom ye have gone in - but if ye have not gone in unto them, then it is  no sin for you (to marry their daughters) - and the wives of your sons who (spring)  from your own loins. And (it is forbidden unto you) that ye should have two sisters  together, except what hath already happened (of that nature) in the past. Lo! Allah is  ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|24|an-Nisa': Women|And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom  your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all  beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock,  not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto  them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual  agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 
4|25|an-Nisa': Women|And whoso is not able to afford to marry free, believing women, let them  marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess. Allah knoweth best  (concerning) your faith. Ye (proceed) one from another; so wed them by permission  of their folk, and give unto them their portions in kindness, they being honest, not  debauched nor of loose conduct. And if when they are honourably married they  commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment (prescribed) for free  women (in that case). This is for him among you who feareth to commit sin. But to  have patience would be better for you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|26|an-Nisa': Women|Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who  were before you, and would turn to you in mercy. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
4|27|an-Nisa': Women|And Allah would turn to you in mercy; but those who follow vain desires  would have you go tremendously astray. 
4|28|an-Nisa': Women|Allah would make the burden light for you, for man was created weak. 
4|29|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity,  except it be a trade by mutual consent, and kill not one another. Lo! Allah is ever  Merciful unto you. 
4|30|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso doeth that through aggression and injustice, we shall cast him into  Fire, and that is ever easy for Allah. 
4|31|an-Nisa': Women|If ye avoid the great (things) which ye are forbidden, We will remit from you  your evil deeds and make you enter at a noble gate. 
4|32|an-Nisa': Women|And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others.  Unto men a fortune from that which they have earned, and unto women a fortune  from that which they have earned. (Envy not one another) but ask Allah of His  bounty. Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things. 
4|33|an-Nisa': Women|And unto each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near  kindred leave; and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant,  give them their due. Lo! Allah is ever Witness over all things. 
4|34|an-Nisa': Women|Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to  excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women).  So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded.  As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds  apart, and scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo!  Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great. 
4|35|an-Nisa': Women|And if ye fear a breach between them twain (the man and wife), appoint an  arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they desire amendment Allah will  make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware. 
4|36|an-Nisa': Women|And serve Allah. Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him. (Show) kindness  unto parents, and unto near kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and unto the  neighbour who is of kin (unto you) and the neighbour who is not of kin, and the  fellow-traveller and the wayfarer and (the slaves) whom your right hands possess. Lo!  Allah loveth not such as are proud and boastful, 
4|37|an-Nisa': Women|Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others, and hide that which  Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty. For disbelievers We prepare a  shameful doom; 
4|38|an-Nisa': Women|And (also) those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men, and  believe not in Allah nor the Last Day. Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade, a bad  comrade hath he. 
4|39|an-Nisa': Women|What have they (to fear) if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend  (aright) of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them, when Allah is ever Aware of  them (and all they do) ? 
4|40|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant; and if there is a good  deed, He will double it and will give (the doer) from His presence an immense  reward. 
4|41|an-Nisa': Women|But how (will it be with them) when We bring of every people a witness, and  We bring thee (O Muhammad) a witness against these ? 
4|42|an-Nisa': Women|On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish  that they were level with the ground, and they can hide no fact from Allah. 
4|43|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye  know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the  road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from  the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean  soil and rub your faces and your hands (therewith). Lo! Allah is Benign, Forgiving. 
4|44|an-Nisa': Women|Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given,  how they purchase error, and seek to make you (Muslims) err from the right way ? 
4|45|an-Nisa': Women|Allah knoweth best (who are) your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a  Guardian, and Allah is sufficient as a Supporter. 
4|46|an-Nisa': Women|Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: "We  hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not" and "Listen to us!" distorting  with their tongues and slandering religion.  If they had said: "We hear and we obey:  hear thou, and look at us" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah  hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few. 
4|47|an-Nisa': Women|O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given! Believe in what We have  revealed confirming that which ye possess, before We destroy countenances so as to  confound them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers (of old time). The  commandment of Allah is always executed. 
4|48|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him. He  forgiveth (all) save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah, he hath  indeed invented a tremendous sin. 
4|49|an-Nisa': Women|Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity ? Nay, Allah  purifieth whom He will, and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a date- stone. 
4|50|an-Nisa': Women|See, how they invent lies about Allah! That of itself is flagrant sin. 
4|51|an-Nisa': Women|Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been  given, how they believe in idols and false deities, and how they say of those  (idolaters) who disbelieve: "These are more rightly guided than those who believe" ? 
4|52|an-Nisa': Women|Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and he whom Allah hath cursed,  thou (O Muhammad) wilt find for him no helper. 
4|53|an-Nisa': Women|Or have they even a share in the Sovereignty ? Then in that case, they would  not give mankind even the speck on a date-stone. 
4|54|an-Nisa': Women|Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which Allah of His bounty  hath bestowed upon them ? For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham (of old) the  Scripture and wisdom, and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom. 
4|55|an-Nisa': Women|And of them were (some) who believed therein and of them were (some)  who turned away from it. Hell is sufficient for (their) burning. 
4|56|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire.  As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they  may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 
4|57|an-Nisa': Women|And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter  Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them are  pure companions - and We shall make them enter plenteous shade. 
4|58|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners, and, if ye  judge between mankind, that ye judge justly. Lo! comely is this which Allah  admonisheth you. Lo! Allah is ever Hearer, Seer. 
4|59|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you  who are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to Allah  and the messenger if ye are (in truth) believers in Allah and the Last Day. That is  better and more seemly in the end. 
4|60|an-Nisa': Women|Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is  revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go for  judgment (in their disputes) to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure  them ? Satan would mislead them far astray. 
4|61|an-Nisa': Women|And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed  and unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion. 
4|62|an-Nisa': Women|How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own  hands have sent before (them) ? Then would they come unto thee, swearing by Allah  that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness. 
4|63|an-Nisa': Women|Those are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth. So oppose them  and admonish them, and address them in plain terms about their souls. 
4|64|an-Nisa': Women|We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave. And  if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked  forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found  Allah Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|65|an-Nisa': Women|But nay, by thy Lord, they will not believe (in truth) until they make thee  judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that  which thou decidest, and submit with full submission. 
4|66|an-Nisa': Women|And if We had decreed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your  dwellings, but few of them would have done it; though if they did what they are  exhorted to do it would be better for them, and more strengthening; 
4|67|an-Nisa': Women|And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense  reward, 
4|68|an-Nisa': Women|And should guide them unto a straight path. 
4|69|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom  Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the  righteous. The best of company are they! 
4|70|an-Nisa': Women|That is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower. 
4|71|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Take your precautions, then advance the proven ones, or  advance all together. 
4|72|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! among you there is he who loitereth; and if disaster overtook you, he  would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them. 
4|73|an-Nisa': Women|And if a bounty from Allah befell you, he would surely cry, as if there had  been no love between you and him: Oh, would that I had been with them, then should  I have achieved a great success! 
4|74|an-Nisa': Women|Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the  other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We  shall bestow a vast reward. 
4|75|an-Nisa': Women|How should ye not fight for the cause of Allah and of the feeble among men  and of the women and the children who are crying: Our Lord! Bring us forth from out  this town of which the people are oppressors! Oh, give us from thy presence some  protecting friend! Oh, give us from Thy presence some defender! 
4|76|an-Nisa': Women|Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve  do battle for the cause of idols. So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the devil's  strategy is ever weak. 
4|77|an-Nisa': Women|Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands,  establish worship and pay the poordue, but when fighting was prescribed for them  behold! a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear,  and say: Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us ? If only Thou wouldst  give us respite yet a while! Say (unto them, O Muhammad): The comfort of this  world is scant; the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off (evil); and ye will  not be wronged the down upon a date-stone. 
4|78|an-Nisa': Women|Wheresoever ye may be, death will overtake you, even though ye were in  lofty towers. Yet if a happy thing befalleth them they say: This is from Allah; and if  an evil thing befalleth them they say: This is of thy doing (O Muhammad). Say (unto  them): All is from Allah. What is amiss with these people that they come not nigh to  understand a happening ? 
4|79|an-Nisa': Women|Whatever of good befalleth thee (O man) it is from Allah, and whatever of ill  befalleth thee it is from thyself. We have sent thee (Muhammad) as a messenger unto  mankind and Allah is sufficient as Witness. 
4|80|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away:  We have not sent thee as a warder over them. 
4|81|an-Nisa': Women|And they say: (It is) obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a  party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah recordeth  what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient  as Trustee. 
4|82|an-Nisa': Women|Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an ? If it had been from other than  Allah they would have found therein much incongruity. 
4|83|an-Nisa': Women|And if any tidings, whether of safety or fear, come unto them, they noise it  abroad, whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in  authority, those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known  it. If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have  followed Satan, save a few (of you). 
4|84|an-Nisa': Women|So fight (O Muhammad) in the way of Allah Thou art not taxed (with the  responsibility for anyone) except thyself - and urge on the believers. Peradventure  Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is stronger in might and  stronger in inflicting punishment. 
4|85|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso  interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. Allah overseeth all  things. 
4|86|an-Nisa': Women|When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better than it or return it.  Lo! Allah taketh count of all things. 
4|87|an-Nisa': Women|Allah! There is no God save Him. He gathereth you all unto a Day of  Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement than Allah ? 
4|88|an-Nisa': Women|What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites,  when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned ? Seek ye to  guide him whom Allah hath sent astray ? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him thou  (O MUhammad) canst not find a road. 
4|89|an-Nisa': Women|They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be  upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their  homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them  wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them, 
4|90|an-Nisa': Women|Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is  a covenant, or (those who) come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make  war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given  them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold  aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you  no way against them. 
4|91|an-Nisa': Women|Ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you, and  security from their own folk. So often as they are returned to hostility they are  plunged therein. If they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor hold their  hands, then take them and kill them wherever ye find them. Against such We have  given you clear warrant. 
4|92|an-Nisa': Women|It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless (it be) by mistake. He who  hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave, and pay the blood- money to the family of the slain, unless they remit it as a charity. If he (the victim) be  of a people hostile unto you, and he is a believer, then (the penance is) to set free a  believing slave. And if he cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a  covenant, then the blood-money must be paid unto his folk and (also) a believing  slave must be set free. And whoso hath not the wherewithal must fast two consecutive  months. A penance from Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
4|93|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell for ever. Allah is  wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom. 
4|94|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, be careful  to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you peace: "Thou art not a  believer," seeking the chance profits of this life (so that ye may despoil him). With  Allah are plenteous spoils. Even thus (as he now is) were ye before; but Allah hath  since then been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to discriminate. Allah is ever  Informed of what ye do. 
4|95|an-Nisa': Women|Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a (disabling)  hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their  wealth and lives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives  a rank above the sedentary. Unto each Allah hath promised good, but He hath  bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the sedentary; 
4|96|an-Nisa': Women|Degrees of rank from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is ever  Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|97|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they wrong  themselves, (the angels) will ask: In what were ye engaged ? They will say: We were  oppressed in the land. (The angels) will say: Was not Allah's earth spacious that ye  could have migrated therein ? As for such, their habitation will be hell, an evil  journey's end; 
4|98|an-Nisa': Women|Except the feeble among men, and the women, and the children, who are  unable to devise a plan and are not shown a way. 
4|99|an-Nisa': Women|As for such, it may be that Allah will pardon them. Allah is ever Clement,  Forgiving. 
4|100|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah will find much refuge and abundance  in the earth, and whoso forsaketh his home, a fugitive unto Allah and His messenger,  and death overtaketh him, his reward is then incumbent on Allah. Allah is ever  Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|101|an-Nisa': Women|And when ye go forth in the land, it is no sin for you to curtail (your)  worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you. In truth the disbelievers  are an open enemy to you. 
4|102|an-Nisa': Women|And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them and arrangest (their)  worship for them, let only a party of them stand with thee (to worship) and let them  take their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the  rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with  thee, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who disbelieve long for  you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all. It is  no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain impedeth you or ye are sick. But take  your precaution. Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment. 
4|103|an-Nisa': Women|When ye have performed the act of worship, remember Allah, standing,  sitting and reclining. And when ye are in safety, observe proper worship. Worship at  fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers. 
4|104|an-Nisa': Women|Relent not in pursuit of the enemy. If ye are suffering, lo! they suffer even as  ye suffer and ye hope from Allah that for which they cannot hope. Allah is ever  Knower, Wise. 
4|105|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! We reveal unto thee the Scripture with the truth, that thou mayst judge  between mankind by that which Allah showeth thee. And be not thou a pleader for the  treacherous; 
4|106|an-Nisa': Women|And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|107|an-Nisa': Women|And plead not on behalf of (people) who deceive themselves. Lo! Allah  loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful. 
4|108|an-Nisa': Women|They seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from Allah. He is with them  when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto Him. Allah ever surroundeth what  they do. 
4|109|an-Nisa': Women|Ho! ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world. But who will  plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will then be their  defender ? 
4|110|an-Nisa': Women|Yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul, then seeketh pardon of  Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|111|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself. Allah is ever  Knower, Wise. 
4|112|an-Nisa': Women|And whoso committeth a delinquency or crime, then throweth (the blame)  thereof upon the innocent, hath burdened himself with falsehood and a flagrant crime. 
4|113|an-Nisa': Women|But for the grace of Allah upon thee (Muhammad), and His mercy, a party of  them had resolved to mislead thee, but they will mislead only themselves and they  will hurt thee not at all. Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture and wisdom, and  teacheth thee that which thou knewest not. The grace of Allah toward thee hath been  infinite. 
4|114|an-Nisa': Women|There is no good in much of their secret conferences save (in) him who  enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making among the people. Whoso  doeth that, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall bestow on him a vast reward. 
4|115|an-Nisa': Women|And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance (of Allah) hath been  manifested unto him, and followeth other than the believer's way, We appoint for him  that unto which he himself hath turned, and expose him unto hell - a hapless journey's  end! 
4|116|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto Him. He  pardoneth all save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah hath  wandered far astray. 
4|117|an-Nisa': Women|They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than Satan, a  rebel 
4|118|an-Nisa': Women|Whom Allah cursed, and he said: Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an  appointed portion, 
4|119|an-Nisa': Women|And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in them,  and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle' ears, and surely I will  command them and they will change Allah's creation. Whoso chooseth Satan for a  patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest. 
4|120|an-Nisa': Women|He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them, and Satan promiseth them  only to beguile. 
4|121|an-Nisa': Women|For such, their habitation will be hell, and they will find no refuge therefrom. 
4|122|an-Nisa': Women|But as for those who believe and do good works We shall bring them into  Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. It is a  promise from Allah in truth; and who can be more truthful than Allah in utterance ? 
4|123|an-Nisa': Women|It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor the desires of the People of  the Scripture. He who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof, and will not  find against Allah any protecting friend or helper. 
4|124|an-Nisa': Women|And whoso doeth good works, whether of male or female, and he (or she) is  a believer, such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a date- stone. 
4|125|an-Nisa': Women|Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah while  doing good (to men) and followeth the tradition of Abraham, the upright ? Allah  (Himself) chose Abraham for friend. 
4|126|an-Nisa': Women|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth. Allah ever surroundeth all things. 
4|127|an-Nisa': Women|They consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree  concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree),  concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained  for them though ye desire to marry them, and (concerning) the weak among children,  and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever  Aware of it. 
4|128|an-Nisa': Women|If a woman feareth ill treatment from her husband, or desertion, it is no sin  for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves. Peace is better. But  greed hath been made present in the minds (of men). If ye do good and keep from  evil, lo! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do. 
4|129|an-Nisa': Women|Ye will not be able to deal equally between (your) wives, however much ye  wish (to do so). But turn not altogether away (from one), leaving her as in suspense. If  ye do good and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|130|an-Nisa': Women|But if they separate, Allah will compensate each out of His abundance. Allah  is ever All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
4|131|an-Nisa': Women|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth. And We charged those who received the Scripture before you, and (We charge)  you, that ye keep your duty toward Allah. And if ye disbelieve, lo! unto Allah  belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and Allah is  ever Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
4|132|an-Nisa': Women|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender. 
4|133|an-Nisa': Women|If He will, He can remove you, O people, and produce others (in your stead).  Allah is Able to do that. 
4|134|an-Nisa': Women|Whoso desireth the reward of the world, (let him know that) with Allah is the  reward of the world and the Hereafter. Allah is ever Hearer, Seer. 
4|135|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Be ye staunch in justice, witnesses for Allah, even though  it be against yourselves or (your) parents or (your) kindred, whether (the case be of) a  rich man or a poor man, for Allah is nearer unto both (them ye are). So follow not  passion lest ye lapse (from truth) and if ye lapse or fall away, then lo! Allah is ever  Informed of what ye do. 
4|136|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture  which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed  aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His  messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray. 
4|137|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! those who believe, then disbelieve and then (again) believe, then  disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never pardon them, nor will He  guide them unto a way. 
4|138|an-Nisa': Women|Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom; 
4|139|an-Nisa': Women|Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers! Do they  look for power at their hands ? Lo! all power appertaineth to Allah. 
4|140|an-Nisa': Women|He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that, when ye hear the  revelations of Allah rejected and derided, (ye) sit not with them (who disbelieve and  mock) until they engage in some other conversation. Lo! in that case (if ye stayed) ye  would be like unto them. Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers, all  together, into hell; 
4|141|an-Nisa': Women|Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto  you from Allah, say: Are we not with you ? and if the disbelievers meet with a  success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the  believers ? - Allah will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will  not give the disbelievers any way (of success) against the believers. 
4|142|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! the hypocrites seek to beguile Allah, but it is He Who beguileth them.  When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men, and  are mindful of Allah but little; 
4|143|an-Nisa': Women|Swaying between this (and that), (belonging) neither to these nor to those.  He whom Allah causeth to go astray, thou (O Muhammad) wilt not find a way for  him: 
4|144|an-Nisa': Women|O ye who believe! Choose not disbelievers for (your) friends in place of  believers. Would ye give Allah a clear warrant against you ? 
4|145|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! the hypocrites (will be) in the lowest deep of the Fire, and thou wilt find  no helper for them; 
4|146|an-Nisa': Women|Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and make their  religion pure for Allah (only). Those are with the believers. And Allah will bestow on  the believers an immense reward. 
4|147|an-Nisa': Women|What concern hath Allah for your punishment if ye are thankful (for His  mercies) and believe (in Him) ? Allah was ever Responsive, Aware. 
4|148|an-Nisa': Women|Allah loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been  wronged. Allah is ever Hearer, Knower. 
4|149|an-Nisa': Women|If ye do good openly or keep it secret, or forgive evil, lo! Allah is ever  Forgiving, Powerful. 
4|150|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and seek to make  distinction between Allah and His messengers, and say: We believe in some and  disbelieve in others, and seek to choose a way in between; 
4|151|an-Nisa': Women|Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful  doom. 
4|152|an-Nisa': Women|But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction  between any of them, unto them Allah will give their wages; and Allah was ever  Forgiving, Merciful. 
4|153|an-Nisa': Women|The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an (actual)  Book to descend upon them from heaven. They asked a greater thing of Moses  aforetime, for they said: Show us Allah plainly. The storm of lightning seized them  for their wickedness. Then (even) after that) they chose the calf (for worship) after  clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) had come unto them. And We forgave them that!  And We bestowed on Moses evident authority. 
4|154|an-Nisa': Women|And We caused the Mount to tower above them at (the taking of) their  covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate, prostrate! and We bode them:  Transgress not the Sabbath! and We took from them a firm covenant. 
4|155|an-Nisa': Women|Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in  the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their  saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for their  disbelief, so that they believe not save a few - 
4|156|an-Nisa': Women|And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a  tremendous calumny; 
4|157|an-Nisa': Women|And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary,  Allah's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto  them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no  knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. 
4|158|an-Nisa': Women|But Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise. 
4|159|an-Nisa': Women|There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before  his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them - 
4|160|an-Nisa': Women|Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which  were (before) made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from  Allah's way, 
4|161|an-Nisa': Women|And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it, and of their  devouring people's wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them  who disbelieve a painful doom. 
4|162|an-Nisa': Women|But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in  that which is revealed unto thee, and that which was revealed before thee, especially  the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poor-due, the believers in Allah and the  Last Day. Upon these We shall bestow immense reward. 
4|163|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, as We  inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job  and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as We imparted unto David the Psalms; 
4|164|an-Nisa': Women|And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We  have not mentioned unto thee; and Allah spake directly unto Moses; 
4|165|an-Nisa': Women|Messengers of good cheer and of warning, in order that mankind might have  no argument against Allah after the messengers. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise. 
4|166|an-Nisa': Women|But Allah (Himself) testifieth concerning that which He hath revealeth unto  thee; in His knowledge hath He revealed it; and the angels also testify. And Allah is  sufficient Witness. 
4|167|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the way of Allah, they  verily have wandered far astray. 
4|168|an-Nisa': Women|Lo! those who disbelieve and deal in wrong, Allah will never forgive them,  neither will He guide them unto a road, 
4|169|an-Nisa': Women|Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever. And that is ever  easy for Allah. 
4|170|an-Nisa': Women|O mankind! The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your  Lord. Therefor believe; (it is) better for you. But if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto Allah  belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise. 
4|171|an-Nisa': Women|O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught  concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a  messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from  Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! (it is)  better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent  Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in  the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender. 
4|172|an-Nisa': Women|The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the favoured  angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him; 
4|173|an-Nisa': Women|Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay  their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were  scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find  for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper. 
4|174|an-Nisa': Women|O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have  sent down unto you a clear light; 
4|175|an-Nisa': Women|As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will  cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight  road. 
4|176|an-Nisa': Women|They ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: Allah hath pronounced for you  concerning distant kindred. If a man die childless and he have a sister, hers is half the  heritage, and he would have inherited from her had she died childless. And if there be  two sisters, then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage, and if they be brethren, men and  women, unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. Allah expoundeth  unto you, so that ye err not. Allah is Knower of all things. 
5|1|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Fulfil your indentures. The beast of cattle is made lawful  unto you (for food) except that which is announced unto you (herein), game being  unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage. Lo! Allah ordaineth that which pleaseth  Him. 
5|2|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Profane not Allah's monuments nor the Sacred Month nor  the offerings nor the garlands, nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking the  grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when ye have left the sacred territory, then go  hunting (if ye will). And let not your hatred of a folk who (once) stopped your going  to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress; but help ye one another  unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and transgression,  but keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is severe in punishment. 
5|3|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Forbidden unto you (for food) are carrion and blood and swineflesh, and that  which hath been dedicated unto any other than Allah, and the strangled, and the dead  through beating, and the dead through falling from a height, and that which hath been  killed by (the goring of) horns, and the devoured of wild beasts, saving that which ye  make lawful (by the death-stroke), and that which hath been immolated unto idols.  And (forbidden is it) that ye swear by the divining arrows. This is an abomination.  This day are those who disbelieve in despair of (ever harming) your religion; so fear  them not, fear Me! This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My  favour unto you, and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam. Whoso is forced by  hunger, not by will, to sin: (for him) lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
5|4|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They ask thee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good  things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have  trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them that which Allah taught you; so eat of  that which they catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it, and observe your  duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is swift to take account. 
5|5|al-Ma'idah: The Food|This day are (all) good things made lawful for you. The food of those who  have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And  so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who  received the Scripture before you (lawful for you) when ye give them their marriage  portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret  concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will be among the losers  in the Hereafter. 
5|6|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer, wash you faces, and your  hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads and (wash) your feet up to the  ankles. And if ye are unclean, purify yourselves. And if ye are sick or on a journey, or  one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have had contact with women, and ye find  not water, then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some  of it. Allah would not place a burden on you, but He would purify you and would  perfect His grace upon you, that ye may give thanks. 
5|7|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Remember Allah's grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you  when ye said: We hear and we obey; And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! He knoweth  what is in the breasts (of men). 
5|8|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity, and let not  hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly. Deal justly, that is nearer to  your duty. Observe your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
5|9|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah hath promised those who believe and do good works: Theirs will be  forgiveness and immense reward. 
5|10|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners  of hell. 
5|11|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Remember Allah's favour unto you, how a people were  minded to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you;  and keep your duty to Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust. 
5|12|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised  among them twelve chieftains, and Allah said: Lo! I am with you. If ye establish  worship and pay the poor-due, and believe in My messengers and support them, and  lend unto Allah a kindly loan, surely I shall remit your sins, and surely I shall bring  you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whoso among you disbelieveth after  this will go astray from a plain road. 
5|13|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and  made hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of that  whereof they were admonished. Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all  save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo! Allah loveth the kindly. 
5|14|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians," We made a covenant, but  they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefor We have stirred up  enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform  them of their handiwork. 
5|15|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you,  expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture, and  forgiving much. now hath come unto you light from Allah and plain Scripture, 
5|16|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Whereby Allah guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure unto paths of  peace. He bringeth them out of darkness unto light by His decree, and guideth them  unto a straight path. 
5|17|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They indeed have disbelieved who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of  Mary. Say: Who then can do aught against Allah, if He had willed to destroy the  Messiah son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth ? Allah's is the  Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He createth  what He will. And Allah is Able to do all things. 
5|18|al-Ma'idah: The Food|The Jews and Christians say: We are sons of Allah and His loved ones. Say:  Why then doth He chastise you for your sins ? Nay, ye are but mortals of His  creating. He forgiveth whom He will, and chastiseth whom He will. Allah's is the  Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and unto Him  is the journeying. 
5|19|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you to make  things plain unto you after an interval (of cessation) of the messengers, lest ye should  say: There came not unto us a messenger of cheer nor any warner. Now hath a  messenger of cheer and a warner come unto you. Allah is Able to do all things. 
5|20|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And (remember) when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Remember  Allah's favour unto you, how He placed among you prophets, and He made you kings,  and gave you that (which) He gave not to any (other) of (His) creatures. 
5|21|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O my people! Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you. Turn  not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers: 
5|22|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They said: O Moses! Lo! a giant people (dwell) therein and lo! we go not in  till they go forth from thence. When they go forth from thence, then we will enter (not  till then). 
5|23|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Then out spake two of those who feared (their Lord, men) unto whom Allah  had been gracious: Enter in upon them by the gate, for if ye enter by it, lo! ye will be  victorious. So put your trust (in Allah) if ye are indeed believers. 
5|24|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They said: O Moses! We will never enter (the land) while they are in it. So  go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit here. 
5|25|al-Ma'idah: The Food|He said: My Lord! I have control of none but myself and my brother, so  distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk. 
5|26|al-Ma'idah: The Food|(Their Lord) said: For this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty  years that they will wander in the earth, bewildered. So grieve not over the  wrongdoing folk. 
5|27|al-Ma'idah: The Food|But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they  offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not  accepted from the other. (The one) said: I will surely kill thee. (The other) answered:  Allah accepteth only from those who ward off (evil). 
5|28|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I shall not stretch out  my hand against thee to kill thee, lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. 
5|29|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Lo! I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me  and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire. That is the reward of  evil-doers. 
5|30|al-Ma'idah: The Food|But (the other's) mind imposed on him the killing of his brother, so he slew  him and became one of the losers. 
5|31|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide  his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven  and so hide my brother's naked corpse ? And he became repentant. 
5|32|al-Ma'idah: The Food|For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a  human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he  had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved  the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs (of  Allah's Sovereignty), but afterwards lo! many of them became prodigals in the earth. 
5|33|al-Ma'idah: The Food|The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and  strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have  their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such  will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful  doom; 
5|34|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
5|35|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah, and seek the way of  approach unto Him, and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed. 
5|36|al-Ma'idah: The Food|As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs, and as  much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection, it  would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom. 
5|37|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They will wish to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth  from it. Theirs will be a lasting doom. 
5|38|al-Ma'idah: The Food|As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands. It is the reward of  their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
5|39|al-Ma'idah: The Food|But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth, lo! Allah will  relent toward him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
5|40|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens  and the earth ? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. Allah is  Able to do all things. 
5|41|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race  to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: "We believe," but their hearts believe  not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other  folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context and saying: If this be  given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto you, then beware! He whom  Allah doometh unto sin, thou (by thine efforts) wilt avail him naught against Allah.  Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs  in the world will be ignominy, and in the Hereafter an awful doom; 
5|42|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Listeners for the sake of falsehood! Greedy for illicit gain! If then they have  recourse unto thee (Muhammad) judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction. If thou  disclaimest jurisdiction, then they cannot harm thee at all. But if thou judgest, judge  between them with equity. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable. 
5|43|al-Ma'idah: The Food|How come they unto thee for judgment when they have the Torah, wherein  Allah hath delivered judgment (for them) ? Yet even after that they turn away. Such  (folk) are not believers. 
5|44|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light, by which the  prophets who surrendered (unto Allah) judged the Jews, and the rabbis and the priests  (judged) by such of Allah's Scripture as they were bidden to observe, and thereunto  were they witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And My revelations for a little  gain. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are disbelievers. 
5|45|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And We prescribed for them therein: The life for the life, and the eye for the  eye, and the nose for the nose, and the ear for the ear, and the tooth for the tooth, and  for wounds retaliation. But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity) it shall be  expiation for him. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are  wrong-doers. 
5|46|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming  that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the  Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before  it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil). 
5|47|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein.  Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are evil-livers. 
5|48|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth, confirming  whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So judge between them by  that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their desires away from the truth  which hath come unto thee. For each We have appointed a divine law and a traced-out  way. Had Allah willed He could have made you one community. But that He may try  you by that which He hath given you (He hath made you as ye are). So vie one with  another in good works. Unto Allah ye will all return, and He will then inform you of  that wherein ye differ. 
5|49|al-Ma'idah: The Food|So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not  their desires, but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that which  Allah hath revealed unto thee. And if they turn away, then know that Allah's Will is to  smite them for some sin of theirs. Lo! many of mankind are evil-livers. 
5|50|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Is it a judgment of the time of (pagan) ignorance that they are seeking ? Who  is better than Allah for judgment to a people who have certainty (in their belief) ? 
5|51|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are  friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them.  Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
5|52|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And thou seest those in whose heart is a disease race toward them, saying:  We fear lest a change of fortune befall us. And it may happen that Allah will  vouchsafe (unto thee) the victory, or a commandment from His presence. Then will  they repent them of their secret thoughts. 
5|53|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Then will the believers say (unto the people of the Scripture): are these they  who swore by Allah their most binding oaths that they were surely with you ? Their  works have failed, and they have become the losers. 
5|54|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Whoso of you becometh a renegade from his religion,  (know that in his stead) Allah will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him,  humble toward believers, stern toward disbelievers, striving in the way of Allah, and  fearing not the blame of any blamer. Such is the grace of Allah which He giveth unto  whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
5|55|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Your guardian can be only Allah; and His messenger and those who believe,  who establish worship and pay the poordue, and bow down (in prayer). 
5|56|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And whoso taketh Allah and His messenger and those who believe for  guardian (will know that), lo! the party of Allah, they are the victorious. 
5|57|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O Ye who believe! Choose not for guardians such of those who received the  Scripture before you, and of the disbelievers, as make a jest and sport of your religion.  But keep your duty to Allah if ye are true believers. 
5|58|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport. That is because  they are a folk who understand not. 
5|59|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Say: O People of the Scripture! Do ye blame us for aught else than that we  believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed  aforetime, and because most of you are evil-livers ? 
5|60|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Shall I tell thee of a worse (case) than theirs for retribution with Allah ?  (Worse is the case of him) whom Allah hath cursed, him on whom His wrath hath  fallen and of whose sort Allah hath turned some to apes and swine, and who serveth  idols. Such are in worse plight and further astray from the plain road. 
5|61|al-Ma'idah: The Food|When they come unto you (Muslims), they say: We believe; but they came in  unbelief and they went out in the same; and Allah knoweth best what they were  hiding. 
5|62|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And thou seest many of them vying one with another in sin and transgression  and their devouring of illicit gain. Verily evil is what they do. 
5|63|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid their evil-speaking and their  devouring of illicit gain ? Verily evil is their handiwork. 
5|64|al-Ma'idah: The Food|The Jews say: Allah's hand is fettered. Their hands are fettered and they are  accursed for saying so. Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide in bounty. He  bestoweth as He will. That which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is  certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them, and We have cast  among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they light a  fire for war, Allah extinguisheth it. Their effort is for corruption in the land, and Allah  loveth not corrupters. 
5|65|al-Ma'idah: The Food|If only the People of the Scripture would believe and ward off (evil), surely  We should remit their sins from them and surely We should bring them into Gardens  of Delight. 
5|66|al-Ma'idah: The Food|If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed  unto them from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above them  and from beneath their feet. Among them there are people who are moderate, but  many of them are of evil conduct. 
5|67|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy  Lord, for if thou do it not, thou wilt not have conveyed His message. Allah will  protect thee from mankind. Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
5|68|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Say O People of the Scripture! Ye have naught (of guidance) till ye observe  the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord. That  which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) from thy Lord is certain to increase the  contumacy and disbelief of many of them. But grieve not for the disbelieving folk. 
5|69|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Lo! those who believe, and those who are Jews, and Sabaeans, and Christians  - Whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - there shall no fear  come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
5|70|al-Ma'idah: The Food|We made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We sent unto  them messengers. As often as a messenger came unto them with that which their souls  desired not (they became rebellious). Some (of them) they denied and some they  slew. 
5|71|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They thought no harm would come of it, so they were wilfully blind and  deaf. And afterward Allah turned (in mercy) toward them. Now (even after that) are  many of them wilfully blind and deaf. Allah is Seer of what they do. 
5|72|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. The  Messiah (himself) said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.  Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, for him Allah hath forbidden paradise. His  abode is the Fire. For evil-doers there will be no helpers. 
5|73|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the third of three; when there is  no God save the One God. If they desist not from so saying a painful doom will fall  on those of them who disbelieve. 
5|74|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Will they not rather turn unto Allah and seek forgiveness of Him ? For Allah  is Forgiving, Merciful. 
5|75|al-Ma'idah: The Food|The Messiah, son of Mary, was no other than a messenger, messengers (the  like of whom) had passed away before him. And his mother was a saintly woman.  And they both used to eat (earthly) food. See how We make the revelations clear for  them, and see how they are turned away! 
5|76|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Say: Serve ye in place of Allah that which possesseth for you neither hurt nor  use ? Allah it is Who is the Hearer, the Knower. 
5|77|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Say: O People of the Scripture! Stress not in your religion other than the  truth, and follow not the vain desires of folk who erred of old and led many astray,  and erred from a plain road. 
5|78|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Those of the Children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of  David, and of Jesus, son of Mary. That was because they rebelled and used to  transgress. 
5|79|al-Ma'idah: The Food|They restrained not one another from the wickedness they did. Verily evil  was that they used to do! 
5|80|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Thou seest many of them making friends with those who disbelieve. Surely  ill for them is that which they themselves send on before them: that Allah will be  wroth with them and in the doom they will abide. 
5|81|al-Ma'idah: The Food|If they believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which is revealed unto  him, they would not choose them for their friends. But many of them are of evil  conduct. 
5|82|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those who  believe (to be) the Jews and the idolaters. And thou wilt find the nearest of them in  affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians. That is  because there are among them priests and monks, and because they are not proud. 
5|83|al-Ma'idah: The Food|When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers, thou  seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth. They  say: Our Lord, we believe. Inscribe us as among the witnesses. 
5|84|al-Ma'idah: The Food|How should we not believe in Allah and that which hath come unto us of the  Truth. And (how should we not) hope that our Lord will bring us in along with  righteous folk ? 
5|85|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah hath rewarded them for that their saying - Gardens underneath which  rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of the good. 
5|86|al-Ma'idah: The Food|But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell- fire. 
5|87|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful  for you, and transgress not, Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors. 
5|88|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good, and  keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye are believers. 
5|89|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths,  but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear in earnest. The expiation  thereof is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed  your own folk, or the clothing of them, or the liberation of a slave, and for him who  findeth not (the wherewithal to do so) then a three days' fast. This is the expiation of  your oaths when ye have sworn; and keep your oaths. Thus Allah expoundeth unto  you His revelations in order that ye may give thanks. 
5|90|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining  arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may  succeed. 
5|91|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong  drink and games of chance, and to turn you from remembrance of Allah and from  (His) worship. Will ye then have done ? 
5|92|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and beware! But if ye turn away, then  know that the duty of Our messenger is only plain conveyance (of the message). 
5|93|al-Ma'idah: The Food|There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who believe and do good works  for what they may have eaten (in the past). So be mindful of your duty (to Allah), and  believe, and do good works; and again: be mindful of your duty, and believe; and  once again: be mindful of your duty, and do right. Allah loveth the good. 
5|94|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Allah will surely try you somewhat (in the matter) of the  game which ye take with your hands and your spears, that Allah may know him who  feareth Him in secret. Whoso transgresseth after this, for him there is a painful doom. 
5|95|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage. Whoso  of you killeth it of set purpose he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which  he hath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you known for  justice, (the forfeit) to be brought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or, for expiation, he  shall feed poor persons, or the equivalent thereof in fasting, that he may taste the evil  consequences of his deed. Allah forgiveth whatever (of this kind) may have happened  in the past, but whoso relapseth, Allah will take retribution from him. Allah is  Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong). 
5|96|al-Ma'idah: The Food|To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you, a provision for  you and for seafarers; but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the  pilgrimage. Be mindful of your duty to Allah, unto Whom ye will be gathered. 
5|97|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah hath appointed the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a standard for mankind,  and the Sacred Month and the offerings and the garlands. That is so that ye may know  that Allah knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and  that Allah is Knower of all things. 
5|98|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Know that Allah is severe in punishment, but that Allah (also) is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
5|99|al-Ma'idah: The Food|The duty of the messenger is only to convey (the message). Allah knoweth  what ye proclaim and what ye hide. 
5|100|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Say: The evil and the good are not alike even though the plenty of the evil  attract thee. So be mindful of your duty to Allah, O men of understanding, that ye  may succeed. 
5|101|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Ask not of things which, if they were made unto you,  would trouble you; but if ye ask of them when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will  be made known unto you. Allah pardoneth this, for Allah is Forgiving, Clement. 
5|102|al-Ma'idah: The Food|A folk before you asked (for such disclosures) and then disbelieved therein. 
5|103|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a  Wasilah or a Hami, but those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah. Most of them  have no sense. 
5|104|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed  and unto the messenger, they say: Enough for us is that wherein we found our fathers.  What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever, and no guidance ? 
5|105|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Ye have charge of your own souls. He who erreth cannot  injure you if ye are rightly guided. Unto Allah ye will all return; and then He will  inform you of what ye used to do. 
5|106|al-Ma'idah: The Food|O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you when death draweth  nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest - two witnesses, just men from among  you, or two others from another tribe, in case ye are campaigning in the land and the  calamity of death befall you. Ye shall empanel them both after the prayer, and, if ye  doubt, they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe, even  though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of Allah,  for then indeed we should be of the sinful. 
5|107|al-Ma'idah: The Food|But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (the suspicion  of) sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned, and let them swear  by Allah, (saying): Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not  transgressed (the bounds of duty), for them indeed we should be of the evil-doers. 
5|108|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their  oaths the oaths (of others) will be taken. So be mindful of your duty (to Allah) and  hearken. Allah guideth not the froward folk. 
5|109|al-Ma'idah: The Food|In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers, and saith: What  was your response (from mankind) ? they say: We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou,  only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden, 
5|110|al-Ma'idah: The Food|When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee  and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou  spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture  and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of clay as it  were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it and it was a bird  by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My  permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and how I  restrained the Children of Israel from (harming) thee when thou camest unto them  with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed: This is naught else  than mere magic; 
5|111|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And when I inspired the disciples, (saying): Believe in Me and in My  messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered (unto Thee)  "we are muslims". 
5|112|al-Ma'idah: The Food|When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down  for us a table spread with food from heaven ? He said: Observe your duty to Allah, if  ye are true believers. 
5|113|al-Ma'idah: The Food|(They said:) We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts and know  that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that thereof we may be witnesses. 
5|114|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table  spread with food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for  the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of  Sustainers. 
5|115|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you  afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished  any of (My) creatures. 
5|116|al-Ma'idah: The Food|And when Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind:  Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah ? he saith: Be glorified! It was not  mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I used to say it, then Thou knewest it.  Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind. Lo! Thou,  only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden ? 
5|117|al-Ma'idah: The Food|I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): Worship  Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them,  and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over  all things. 
5|118|al-Ma'idah: The Food|If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them (lo!  they are Thy slaves). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. 
5|119|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Allah saith: This is a day in which their truthfulness profiteth the truthful, for  theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are secure for ever,  Allah taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the great triumph. 
5|120|al-Ma'idah: The Food|Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and  whatsoever is therein, and He is Able to do all things. 
6|1|al-An`am: The Cattle|Praise be to Allah, Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and hath  appointed darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals unto their Lord. 
6|2|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who hath created you from clay, and hath decreed a term for you. A  term is fixed with Him. Yet still ye doubt! 
6|3|al-An`am: The Cattle|He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knoweth both your secret and  your utterance, and He knoweth what ye earn. 
6|4|al-An`am: The Cattle|Never came there unto them a revelation of the revelations of Allah but they  did turn away from it. 
6|5|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they denied the truth when it came unto them. But there will come unto  them the tidings of that which they used to deride. 
6|6|al-An`am: The Cattle|See they not how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We  had established in the earth more firmly than We have established you, and We shed  on them abundant showers from the sky, and made the rivers flow beneath them.  Yet  we destroyed them for their sins, and created after them another generation. 
6|7|al-An`am: The Cattle|Had we sent down unto thee (Muhammad) (actual) writing upon parchment,  so that they could feel it with their hands, those who disbelieve would have said: This  is naught else than mere magic. 
6|8|al-An`am: The Cattle|They say: Why hath not an angel been sent down unto him ? If We sent  down an angel, then the matter would be judged; no further time would be allowed  them (for reflection). 
6|9|al-An`am: The Cattle|Had we appointed him (Our messenger) an angel, We assuredly had made  him (as) a man (that he might speak to men); and (thus) obscured for them (the truth)  they (now) obscure. 
6|10|al-An`am: The Cattle|Messengers (of Allah) have been derided before thee, but that whereat they  scoffed surrounded such of them as did deride. 
6|11|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say (unto the disbelievers): Travel in the land, and see the nature of the  consequence for the rejecters! 
6|12|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth ? Say:  Unto Allah. He hath prescribed for Himself mercy, that He may bring you all together  to the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Those who ruin their souls will  not believe. 
6|13|al-An`am: The Cattle|Unto Him belongeth whatsoever resteth in the night and the day. He is the  Hearer, the Knower. 
6|14|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Shall I choose for a protecting friend other than Allah, the Originator of  the heavens and the earth, Who feedeth and is never fed ? Say: I am ordered to be the  first to surrender (unto Him). And be not thou (O Muhammad) of the idolaters. 
6|15|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the retribution of an Awful Day. 
6|16|al-An`am: The Cattle|He from whom (such retribution) is averted on that day, (Allah) hath in truth  had mercy on him. That will be the signal triumph. 
6|17|al-An`am: The Cattle|If Allah touch thee with affliction, there is none that can relieve therefrom  save Him, and if He touch thee with good fortune (there is none that can impair it);  for He is Able to do all things. 
6|18|al-An`am: The Cattle|He is the Omnipotent over His slaves, and He is the Wise, the Knower. 
6|19|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say (O Muhammad): What thing is of most weight in testimony ? Say: Allah  is Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an hath been inspired in me, that I may  warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach. Do ye in sooth bear witness that  there are gods beside Allah ? Say: I bear no such witness. Say: He is only One God.  Lo! I am innocent of that which ye associate (with Him). 
6|20|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as they  recognise their sons. Those who ruin their own souls will not believe. 
6|21|al-An`am: The Cattle|Who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denieth  His revelations ? Lo! the wrongdoers will not be successful. 
6|22|al-An`am: The Cattle|And on the day We gather them together We shall say unto those who  ascribed partners (unto Allah): Where are (now) those partners of your make-believe  ? 
6|23|al-An`am: The Cattle|Then will they have no contention save that they will say: By Allah, our  Lord, we never were idolaters. 
6|24|al-An`am: The Cattle|See how they lie against themselves, and (how) the thing which they devised  hath failed them! 
6|25|al-An`am: The Cattle|Of them are some who listen unto thee, but We have placed upon their hearts  veils, lest they should understand, and in their ears a deafness. If they saw every token  they would not believe therein; to the point that, when they come unto thee to argue  with thee, the disbelievers say: This is naught else than fables of the men of old. 
6|26|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they forbid (men) from it and avoid it, and they ruin none save  themselves, though they perceive not. 
6|27|al-An`am: The Cattle|If thou couldst see when they are set before the Fire and say: Oh, would that  we might return! Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord but we would  be of the believers! 
6|28|al-An`am: The Cattle|Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide.  And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden. Lo!  they are liars. 
6|29|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they say: There is naught save our life of the world, and we shall not be  raised (again). 
6|30|al-An`am: The Cattle|If thou couldst see when they are set before their Lord! He will say: Is not  this real ? They will say: Yea, verily, by our Lord! He will say: Taste now the  retribution for that ye used to disbelieve. 
6|31|al-An`am: The Cattle|They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah until, when the  Hour cometh on them suddenly, they cry: Alas for us, that we neglected it! They bear  upon their backs their burdens. Ah, evil is that which they bear! 
6|32|al-An`am: The Cattle|Naught is the life of the world save a pastime and a spot. Better far is the  abode of the Hereafter for those who keep their duty (to Allah). Have ye then no  sense ? 
6|33|al-An`am: The Cattle|We know well how their talk grieveth thee, though in truth they deny not  thee (Muhammad) but evil-doers flout the revelations of Allah. 
6|34|al-An`am: The Cattle|Messengers indeed have been denied before thee, and they were patient  under the denial and the persecution till Our succour reached them. There is none to  alter the decisions of Allah. Already there hath reached thee (somewhat) of the tidings  of the messengers (We sent before). 
6|35|al-An`am: The Cattle|And if their aversion is grievous unto thee, then, if thou canst, seek a way  down into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a portent  (to convince them all)! - If Allah willed, He could have brought them all together to  the guidance - So be not thou among the foolish ones. 
6|36|al-An`am: The Cattle|Only those can accept who hear. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up;  then unto Him they will be returned. 
6|37|al-An`am: The Cattle|They say: Why hath no portent been sent down upon him from his Lord ?  Say: Lo! Allah is Able to send down a portent. But most of them know not. 
6|38|al-An`am: The Cattle|There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings,  but they are peoples like unto you. We have neglected nothing in the Book (of Our  decrees). Then unto their Lord they will be gathered. 
6|39|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness. Whom  Allah will sendeth astray, and whom He will He placeth on a straight path. 
6|40|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Can ye see yourselves, if the punishment of Allah come upon you or the  Hour come upon you, (calling upon other than Allah) ? Do ye then call (for help) to  any other than Allah ? (Answer that) if ye are truthful. 
6|41|al-An`am: The Cattle|Nay, but unto Him ye call, and He removeth that because of which ye call  unto Him, if He will, and ye forget whatever partners ye ascribed unto Him. 
6|42|al-An`am: The Cattle|We have sent already unto peoples that were before thee, and We visited  them with tribulation and adversity, in order that they might grow humble. 
6|43|al-An`am: The Cattle|If only, when Our disaster came on them, they had been humble! But their  hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do seem fair unto them! 
6|44|al-An`am: The Cattle|Then, when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We opened  unto them the gates of all things till, even as they were rejoicing in that which they  were given, We  seized them unawares, and lo! they were dumbfounded. 
6|45|al-An`am: The Cattle|So of the people who did wrong the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to  Allah, Lord of the Worlds! 
6|46|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Have ye imagined, if Allah should take away your hearing and your  sight and seal your hearts, Who is the God Who could restore it to you save Allah ?  See how We display the revelations unto them! Yet still they turn away. 
6|47|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Can ye see yourselves, if the punishment of Allah come upon you  unawares or openly ? Would any perish save wrongdoing folk ? 
6|48|al-An`am: The Cattle|We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners.  Whoso believeth and doeth right, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall  they grieve. 
6|49|al-An`am: The Cattle|But as for those who deny Our revelations, torment will afflict them for that  they used to disobey. 
6|50|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): I say not unto you (that) I possess  the treasures of Allah, nor that I have knowledge of the Unseen; and I say not unto  you: Lo! I am an angel. I follow only that which is inspired in me. Say: Are the blind  man and the seer equal ? Will ye not then take thought ? 
6|51|al-An`am: The Cattle|Warn hereby those who fear (because they know) that they will be gathered  unto their Lord, for whom there is no protecting ally nor intercessor beside Him, that  they may ward off (evil). 
6|52|al-An`am: The Cattle|Repel not those who call upon their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His  Countenance. Thou art not accountable for them in aught, nor are they accountable  for thee in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong-doers. 
6|53|al-An`am: The Cattle|And even so do We try some of them by others, that they say: Are these they  whom Allah favoureth among us ? Is not Allah best Aware of the thanksgivers ? 
6|54|al-An`am: The Cattle|And when those who believe in Our revelations come unto thee, say: Peace  be unto you! Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy, that whoso of you doeth  evil through ignorance and repenteth afterward thereof and doeth right, (for him) lo!  He is Forgiving, Merciful. 
6|55|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus do We expound the revelations that the way of the unrighteous may be  manifest. 
6|56|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: I am forbidden to worship those on whom ye call instead of Allah. Say:  I will not follow your desires, for then should I go astray and I should not be of the  rightly guided. 
6|57|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: I am (relying) on clear proof from my Lord, while ye deny Him. I have  not that for which ye are impatient. The decision is for Allah only. He telleth the truth  and He is the Best of Deciders. 
6|58|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: If I had that for which ye are impatient, then would the case (ere this)  have been decided between me and you. Allah is Best Aware of the wrong-doers. 
6|59|al-An`am: The Cattle|And with Him are the keys of the Invisible. None but He knoweth them. And  He knoweth what is in the land and the sea. Not a leaf falleth but He knoweth it, not a  grain amid the darkness of the earth, naught of wet or dry but (it is noted) in a clear  record. 
6|60|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who gathereth you at night and knoweth that which ye commit by  day. Then He raiseth you again to life therein, that the term appointed (for you) may  be accomplished. And afterward unto Him is your return. Then He will proclaim unto  you what ye used to do. 
6|61|al-An`am: The Cattle|He is the Omnipotent over His slaves. He sendeth guardians over you until,  when death cometh unto one of you, Our messengers receive him, and they neglect  not. 
6|62|al-An`am: The Cattle|Then are they restored unto Allah, their Lord, the Just. Surely His is the  judgment. And He is the most swift of reckoners. 
6|63|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and the sea ? Ye call  upon Him humbly and in secret, (saying): If we are delivered from this (fear) we truly  will be of the thankful. 
6|64|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Allah delivereth you from this and from all affliction. Yet ye attribute  partners unto Him. 
6|65|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: He is able to send punishment upon you from above you or from  beneath your feet, or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny  one of another. See how We display the revelations so that they may understand. 
6|66|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thy people (O Muhammad) have denied it, though it is the Truth. Say: I am  not put in charge of you. 
6|67|al-An`am: The Cattle|For every announcement there is a term, and ye will come to know. 
6|68|al-An`am: The Cattle|And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations, withdraw from  them until they meddle with another topic. And if the devil cause thee to forget, sit  not, after the remembrance, with the congregation of wrong-doers. 
6|69|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those who ward off (evil) are not accountable for them in aught, but the  Reminder (must be given them) that haply they (too) may ward off (evil). 
6|70|al-An`am: The Cattle|And forsake those who take their religion for a pastime and a jest, and whom  the life of the world beguileth. Remind (mankind) hereby lest a soul be destroyed by  what it earneth. It hath beside Allah no protecting ally nor intercessor, and though it  offer every compensation it will not be accepted from it. Those are they who perish  by their own deserts. For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom, because  they disbelieved. 
6|71|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Shall we cry, instead of unto Allah, unto that which neither profiteth us  nor hurteth us, and shall we turn back after Allah hath guided us, like one bewildered  whom the devils have infatuated in the earth, who hath companions who invite him to  the guidance (saying): Come unto us ? Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah is Guidance,  and we are ordered to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds, 
6|72|al-An`am: The Cattle|And to establish worship and be dutiful to Him, and He it is unto Whom ye  will be gathered. 
6|73|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth. In the day when He  saith: Be! it is. His Word is the Truth, and His will be the Sovereignty on the day  when the trumpet is blown. Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, He is the Wise,  the Aware. 
6|74|al-An`am: The Cattle|(Remember) when Abraham said unto his father Azar: Takest thou idols for  gods ? Lo! I see thee and thy folk in error manifest. 
6|75|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that  he might be of those possessing certainty: 
6|76|al-An`am: The Cattle|When the night grew dark upon him he beheld a star. He said: This is my  Lord. But when it set, he said: I love not things that set. 
6|77|al-An`am: The Cattle|And when he saw the moon uprising, he exclaimed: This is my Lord. But  when it set, he said: Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk  who are astray. 
6|78|al-An`am: The Cattle|And when he saw the sun uprising, he cried: This is my Lord! This is  greater! And when it set he exclaimed: O my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye  associate (with Him). 
6|79|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lo! I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the  earth, as one by nature upright, and I am not of the idolaters. 
6|80|al-An`am: The Cattle|His people argued with him. He said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah  when He hath guided me ? I fear not at all that which ye set up beside Him unless my  Lord willeth aught. My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge. Will ye not then  remember ? 
6|81|al-An`am: The Cattle|How should I fear that which ye set up beside Him, when ye fear not to set  up beside Allah that for which He hath revealed unto you no warrant ? Which of the  two factions hath more right to safety ? (Answer me that) if ye have knowledge. 
6|82|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing, theirs is  safety; and they are rightly guided. 
6|83|al-An`am: The Cattle|That is Our argument. We gave it unto Abraham against his folk. We raise  unto degrees of wisdom whom We will. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware. 
6|84|al-An`am: The Cattle|And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob; each of them We guided; and  Noah did We guide aforetime; and of his seed (We guided) David and Solomon and  Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good. 
6|85|al-An`am: The Cattle|And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. Each one (of them) was of the  righteous. 
6|86|al-An`am: The Cattle|And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. Each one (of them) did We  prefer above (Our) creatures, 
6|87|al-An`am: The Cattle|With some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and We  chose them and guided them unto a straight path. 
6|88|al-An`am: The Cattle|Such is the guidance of Allah wherewith He guideth whom He will of His  bondmen. But if they had set up (for worship) aught beside Him, (all) that they did  would have been vain. 
6|89|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those are they unto whom We gave the Scripture and command and  prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein, then indeed We shall entrust it to a  people who will not be disbelievers therein. 
6|90|al-An`am: The Cattle|Those are they whom Allah guideth, so follow their guidance. Say (O  Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for it. Lo! it is naught but a Reminder  to (His) creatures. 
6|91|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they measure not the power of Allah its true measure when they say:  Allah hath naught revealed unto a human being. Say (unto the Jews who speak thus):  Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for mankind,  which ye have put on parchments which ye show, but ye hide much (thereof), and (by  which) ye were taught that which ye knew not yourselves nor (did) your fathers  (know it) ? Say: Allah. Then leave them to their play of cavilling. 
6|92|al-An`am: The Cattle|And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed, confirming that  which (was revealed) before it, that thou mayst warn the Mother of Villages and those  around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe herein, and they are careful of  their worship. 
6|93|al-An`am: The Cattle|Who is guilty of more wrong than he who forgeth a lie against Allah, or  saith: I am inspired, when he is not inspired in aught; and who saith: I will reveal the  like of that which Allah hath revealed ? If thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers  reach the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out (saying): Deliver up  your souls. This day ye are awarded doom of degradation for that ye spake  concerning Allah other than the truth, and used to scorn His portents. 
6|94|al-An`am: The Cattle|Now have ye come unto Us solitary as We did create you at the first, and ye  have left behind you all that We bestowed upon you, and We behold not with you  those your intercessors, of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you. Now  is the bond between you severed, and that which ye presumed hath failed you. 
6|95|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lo! Allah (it is) Who splitteth the grain of corn and the date-stone (for  sprouting). He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and is the bringer-forth of the  dead from the living. Such is Allah. How then are ye perverted ? 
6|96|al-An`am: The Cattle|He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak, and He hath appointed the night for  stillness, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. That is the measuring of the  Mighty, the Wise. 
6|97|al-An`am: The Cattle|And He it is Who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide your course by  them amid the darkness of the land and the sea. We have detailed Our revelations for  a people who have knowledge. 
6|98|al-An`am: The Cattle|And He it is Who hath produced you from a single being, and (hath given  you) a habitation and a repository. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who  have understanding. 
6|99|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, and therewith We bring forth  buds of every kind; We bring forth the green blade from which We bring forth the  thick-clustered grain; and from the date-palm, from the pollen thereof, spring pendant  bunches; and (We bring forth) gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate,  alike and unlike. Look upon the fruit thereof, when they bear fruit, and upon its  ripening. Lo! herein verily are portents for a people who believe. 
6|100|al-An`am: The Cattle|Yet they ascribe as partners unto Him the jinn, although He did create them,  and impute falsely, without knowledge, sons and daughters unto Him. Glorified be He  and High Exalted above (all) that they ascribe (unto Him). 
6|101|al-An`am: The Cattle|The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a child, when  there is for Him no consort, when He created all things and is Aware of all things ? 
6|102|al-An`am: The Cattle|Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no God save Him, the Creator of all  things, so worship Him. And He taketh care of all things. 
6|103|al-An`am: The Cattle|Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth (all) vision. He is the  Subtile, the Aware. 
6|104|al-An`am: The Cattle|Proofs have come unto you from your Lord, so whoso seeth, it is for his own  good, and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper over you. 
6|105|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus do We display Our revelations that they may say (unto thee,  Muhammad): "Thou hast studied," and that We may make (it) clear for people who  have knowledge. 
6|106|al-An`am: The Cattle|Follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord; there is no God save  Him; and turn away from the idolaters. 
6|107|al-An`am: The Cattle|Had Allah willed, they had not been idolatrous. We have not set thee as a  keeper over them, nor art thou responsible for them. 
6|108|al-An`am: The Cattle|Revile not those unto whom they pray beside Allah lest they wrongfully  revile Allah through ignorance. Thus unto every nation have We made their deed  seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return, and He will tell them what they used to  do. 
6|109|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they swear a solemn oath by Allah that if there come unto them a  portent they will believe therein. Say; Portents are with Allah and (so is) that which  telleth you that if such came unto them they would not believe. 
6|110|al-An`am: The Cattle|We confound their hearts and their eyes. As they believed not therein at the  first, We let them wander blindly on in their contumacy. 
6|111|al-An`am: The Cattle|And though We should send down the angels unto them, and the dead should  speak unto them, and We should gather against them all things in array, they would  not believe unless Allah so willed. Howbeit, most of them are ignorant. 
6|112|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary - devils of  humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile. If  thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their devising; 
6|113|al-An`am: The Cattle|That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto,  and that they may take pleasure therein, and that they may earn what they are earning. 
6|114|al-An`am: The Cattle|Shall I seek other than Allah for judge, when He it is Who hath revealed unto  you (this) Scripture, fully explained ? Those unto whom We gave the Scripture  (aforetime) know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not thou (O  Muhammad) of the waverers. 
6|115|al-An`am: The Cattle|Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that  can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
6|116|al-An`am: The Cattle|If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from  Allah's way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess. 
6|117|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way; and He knoweth  best (who are) the rightly guided. 
6|118|al-An`am: The Cattle|Eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned, if ye are  believers in His revelations. 
6|119|al-An`am: The Cattle|How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been  mentioned, when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless  ye are compelled thereto. But lo! many are led astray by their own lusts through  ignorance. Lo! thy Lord, He is Best Aware of the transgressors. 
6|120|al-An`am: The Cattle|Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof. Lo! those who  garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned. 
6|121|al-An`am: The Cattle|And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned, for lo! it  is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you. But if ye  obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters. 
6|122|al-An`am: The Cattle|Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a light  wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence  he cannot emerge ? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers. 
6|123|al-An`am: The Cattle|And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones, that they  should plot therein. They do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not. 
6|124|al-An`am: The Cattle|And when a token cometh unto them, they say: We will not believe till we  are given that which Allah's messengers are given. Allah knoweth best with whom to  place His message. Humiliation from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the  guilty for their scheming. 
6|125|al-An`am: The Cattle|And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the  Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close  and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus Allah layeth ignominy upon  those who believe not. 
6|126|al-An`am: The Cattle|This is the path of thy Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our revelations  for a people who take heed. 
6|127|al-An`am: The Cattle|For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their Protecting  Friend because of what they used to do. 
6|128|al-An`am: The Cattle|In the day when He will gather them together (He will say): O ye assembly  of the jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce. And their adherents among  humankind will say: Our Lord! We enjoyed one another, but now we have arrived at  the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us. He will say: Fire is your home.  Abide therein for ever, save him whom Allah willeth (to deliver). Lo! thy Lord is  Wise, Aware. 
6|129|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus We let some of the wrong-doers have power over others because of  what they are wont to earn. 
6|130|al-An`am: The Cattle|O ye assembly of the jinn and humankind! Came there not unto you  messengers of your own who recounted unto you My tokens and warned you of the  meeting of this your Day ? They will say: We testify against ourselves. And the life of  the world beguiled them. And they testify against themselves that they were  disbelievers. 
6|131|al-An`am: The Cattle|This is because thy Lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while their  people are unconscious (of the wrong they do). 
6|132|al-An`am: The Cattle|For all there will be ranks from what they did. Thy Lord is not unaware of  what they do. 
6|133|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thy Lord is the Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. If He will, He can remove you  and can cause what He will to follow after you, even as He raised you from the seed  of other folk. 
6|134|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lo! that which ye are promised will surely come to pass, and ye cannot  escape. 
6|135|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say (O Muhammad): O my people! Work according to your power. Lo! I too  am working. Thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel. Lo!  the wrong-doers will not be successful. 
6|136|al-An`am: The Cattle|They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion,  and they say: "This is Allah's" - in their make-believe - "and this is for (His) partners  in regard to us." Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not  Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil  is their ordinance. 
6|137|al-An`am: The Cattle|Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their  children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make  their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So  leave them alone with their devices. 
6|138|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they say: Such cattle and crops are forbidden. No-one is to eat of them  save whom we will - in their make-believe - cattle whose backs are forbidden, cattle  over which they mention not the name of Allah. (All that is) a lie against Him. He  will repay them for that which they invent. 
6|139|al-An`am: The Cattle|And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle is reserved for our  males and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead, then they (all) may be  partakers thereof. He will reward them for their attribution (of such ordinances unto  Him). Lo, He is Wise, Aware. 
6|140|al-An`am: The Cattle|They are losers who besottedly have slain their children without knowledge,  and have forbidden that which Allah bestowed upon them, inventing a lie against  Allah. They indeed have gone astray and are not guided. 
6|141|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised, and the date-palm,  and crops of divers flavour, and the olive and the pomegranate, like and unlike. Eat ye  of the fruit thereof when it fruiteth, and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day, and  be not prodigal. Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals. 
6|142|al-An`am: The Cattle|And of the cattle (He produceth) some for burdens, some for food. Eat of that  which Allah hath bestowed upon you, and follow not the footsteps of the devil, for lo!  he is an open foe to you. 
6|143|al-An`am: The Cattle|Eight pairs: Of the sheep twain, and of the goats twain. Say: Hath He  forbidden the two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two  females contain ? Expound to me (the case) with knowledge, if ye are truthful. 
6|144|al-An`am: The Cattle|And of the camels twain and of the oxen twain. Say: Hath He forbidden the  two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain; or  were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you (all) this ? Then who doth greater  wrong than he who deviseth a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead mankind astray  without knowledge. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
6|145|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater  that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swineflesh - for that  verily is foul - or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than  Allah. But whoso is compelled (thereto), neither craving nor transgressing, (for him)  lo! thy Lord is Forgiving, Merciful. 
6|146|al-An`am: The Cattle|Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the  oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or  the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That we awarded them for their  rebellion. And lo! we verily are truthful. 
6|147|al-An`am: The Cattle|So if they give the lie to thee (Muhammad), say: Your Lord is a Lord of All- Embracing Mercy, and His wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk. 
6|148|al-An`am: The Cattle|They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto  Him) partners neither had our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught. Thus did those  who were before them give the lie (to Allah's messengers) till they tasted of the fear  of Us. Say: Have ye any knowledge that ye can adduce for Us ? Lo! ye follow naught  but an opinion, Lo! ye do but guess. 
6|149|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say - For Allah's is the final argument - Had He willed He could indeed have  guided all of you. 
6|150|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade  (all) this. And if they bear witness, do not thou bear witness with them. Follow thou  not the whims of those who deny Our revelations, those who believe not in the  Hereafter and deem (others) equal with their Lord. 
6|151|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred  duty for you: That ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him and that ye do good to  parents, and that ye slay not your children because of penury - We provide for you  and for them - and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things whether open or concealed.  And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in the course of  justice. This He hath command you, in order that ye may discern. 
6|152|al-An`am: The Cattle|And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better, till  he reach maturity. Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task not any soul  beyond its scope. And if ye give your word, do justice thereunto, even though it be  (against) a kinsman; and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This He commandeth you that  haply ye may remember. 
6|153|al-An`am: The Cattle|And (He commandeth you, saying): This is My straight path, so follow it.  Follow not other ways, lest ye be parted from His way. This hath He ordained for  you, that ye may ward off (evil). 
6|154|al-An`am: The Cattle|Again, We gave the Scripture unto Moses, complete for him who would do  good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, that they might believe in  the meeting with their Lord. 
6|155|al-An`am: The Cattle|And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed. So follow it and  ward off (evil), that ye may find mercy. 
6|156|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lest ye should say: The Scripture was revealed only to two sects before us,  and we in sooth were unaware of what they read; 
6|157|al-An`am: The Cattle|Or lest ye should say: If the Scripture had been revealed unto us, we surely  had been better guided than are they. Now hath there come unto you a clear proof  from your Lord, a guidance and mercy; and who doeth greater wrong than he who  denieth the revelations of Allah, and turneth away from them ? We award unto those  who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion. 
6|158|al-An`am: The Cattle|Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto  them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy  Lord ? In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh, its belief availeth  naught a soul which theretofore believed not, nor in its belief earned good (by works).  Say: Wait ye! Lo! We (too) are waiting. 
6|159|al-An`am: The Cattle|Lo! As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics, no  concern at all hast thou with them. Their case will go to Allah, Who then will tell  them what they used to do. 
6|160|al-An`am: The Cattle|Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof, while  whoso bringeth an ill-deed will be awarded but the like thereof; and they will not be  wronged. 
6|161|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Lo! As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path, a right  religion, the community of Abraham, the upright, who was no idolater. 
6|162|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for  Allah, Lord of the Worlds. 
6|163|al-An`am: The Cattle|He hath no partner. This am I commanded, and I am first of those who  surrender (unto Him). 
6|164|al-An`am: The Cattle|Say: Shall I seek another than Allah for Lord, when He is Lord of all things ?  Each soul earneth only on its own account, nor doth any laden bear another's load.  Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that wherein ye differed. 
6|165|al-An`am: The Cattle|He it is Who hath placed you as viceroys of the  earth and hath exalted some  of you in rank above others, that He may try you by (the test of) that which He hath  given you. Lo! Thy Lord is swift in prosecution, and Lo! He verily is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
7|1|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad. 
7|2|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|(It is) a Scripture that is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) - so let there be no  heaviness in thy heart therefrom - that thou mayst warn thereby, and (it is) a  Reminder unto believers. 
7|3|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|(Saying): Follow that which is sent down unto you from your Lord, and  follow no protecting friends beside Him. Little do ye recollect! 
7|4|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|How many a township have We destroyed! As a raid by night, or while they  slept at noon, Our terror came unto them. 
7|5|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|No plea had they, when Our terror came unto them, save that they said: Lo!  We were wrong-doers. 
7|6|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then verily We shall question those unto whom (Our message) hath been  sent, and verily We shall question the messengers. 
7|7|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then verily We shall narrate unto them (the event) with knowledge, for We  were not absent (when it came to pass). 
7|8|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The weighing on that day is the true (weighing). As for those whose scale is  heavy, they are the successful. 
7|9|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And as for those whose scale is light: those are they who lose their souls  because they used to wrong Our revelations. 
7|10|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We have given you (mankind) power in the earth, and appointed for you  therein livelihoods. Little give ye thanks! 
7|11|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We created you, then fashioned you, then told the angels: Fall ye  prostrate before Adam! And they fell prostrate, all save Iblis, who was not of those  who make prostration. 
7|12|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: What hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when I bade  thee ? (Iblis) said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire while him Thou  didst create of mud. 
7|13|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Then go down hence! It is not for thee to show pride here, so go  forth! Lo! thou art of those degraded. 
7|14|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Reprieve me till the day when they are raised (from the dead). 
7|15|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved. 
7|16|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in  ambush for them on Thy Right Path. 
7|17|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and  from their right hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them  beholden (unto Thee). 
7|18|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Go forth from hence, degraded, banished. As for such of them as  follow thee, surely I will fill hell with all of you. 
7|19|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And (unto man): O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat  from whence ye will, but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers. 
7|20|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which  was hidden from them of their shame, and he said: Your Lord forbade you from this  tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals. 
7|21|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you. 
7|22|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Thus did he lead them on with guile. And when they tasted of the tree their  shame was manifest to them and they began to hide (by heaping) on themselves some  of the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called them, (saying): Did I not forbid  you from that tree and tell you: Lo! Satan is an open enemy to you ? 
7|23|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If thou forgive us not and  have not mercy on us, surely we are of the lost! 
7|24|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Go down (from hence), one of you a foe unto the other. There will  be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a while. 
7|25|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: There shall ye live, and there shall ye die, and thence shall ye be  brought forth. 
7|26|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|O Children of Adam! We have revealed unto you raiment to conceal your  shame, and splendid vesture, but the raiment of restraint from evil, that is best. This is  of the revelations of Allah, that they may remember. 
7|27|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|O Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you as he caused your (first)  parents to go forth from the Garden and tore off from them their robe (of innocence)  that he might manifest their shame to them. Lo! he seeth you, he and his tribe, from  whence ye see him not. Lo! We have made the devils protecting friends for those who  believe not. 
7|28|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when they do some lewdness they say: We found our fathers doing it  and Allah hath enjoined it on us. Say: Allah, verily, enjoineth not lewdness. Tell ye  concerning Allah that which ye know not ? 
7|29|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Say: My Lord enjoineth justice. And set your faces upright (toward Him) at  every place of worship and call upon Him, making religion pure for Him (only). As  He brought you into being, so return ye (unto Him). 
7|30|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|A party hath He led aright, while error hath just hold over (another) party, for  lo! they choose the devils for protecting supporters instead of Allah and deem that  they are rightly guided. 
7|31|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|O Children of Adam! Look to your adornment at every place of worship, and  eat and drink, but be not prodigal. Lo! He loveth not the prodigals. 
7|32|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Say: Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allah which He hath brought  forth for His bondmen, and the good things of His providing ? Say: Such, on the Day  of Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world. Thus  do we detail Our revelations for people who have knowledge. 
7|33|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Say: My Lord forbiddeth only indecencies, such of them as are apparent and  such as are within, and sin and wrongful oppression, and that ye associate with Allah  that for which no warrant hath been revealed, and that ye tell concerning Allah that  which ye know not. 
7|34|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And every nation hath its term, and when its term cometh, they cannot put it  off an hour nor yet advance (it). 
7|35|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|O Children of Adam! When messengers of your own come unto you who  narrate unto you My revelations, then whosoever refraineth from evil and amendeth -  there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
7|36|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But they who deny Our revelations and scorn them  - each are rightful  owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. 
7|37|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or  denieth Our tokens. (For such) their appointed portion of the Book (of destiny)  reacheth them till, when Our messengers come to gather them, they say: Where (now)  is that to which ye cried beside Allah ? They say: They have departed from us. And  they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers. 
7|38|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He saith: Enter into the Fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who  passed away before you. Every time a nation entereth, it curseth its sister (nation) till,  when they have all been made to follow one another thither, the last of them saith  unto the first of them: Our Lord! These led us astray, so give them double torment of  the Fire. He saith: For each one there is double (torment), but ye know not. 
7|39|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the first of them saith unto the last of them: Ye were no whit better than  us, so taste the doom for what ye used to earn. 
7|40|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! they who deny Our revelations and scorn them, for them the gates of  heaven will nor be opened not will they enter the Garden until the camel goeth  through the needle's eye. Thus do We requite the guilty. 
7|41|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Theirs will be a bed of hell, and over them coverings (of hell). Thus do We  requite wrong-doers. 
7|42|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But (as for) those who believe and do good works - We tax not any soul  beyond its scope - Such are rightful owners of the Garden. They abide therein. 
7|43|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. Rivers flow  beneath them. And they say: The praise to Allah, Who hath guided us to this. We  could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us. Verily the messengers  of our Lord did bring the Truth. And it is cried unto them: This is the Garden. Ye  inherit it for what ye used to do. 
7|44|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the dwellers of the Garden cry unto the dwellers of the Fire: We have  found that which our Lord promised us (to be) the Truth. Have ye (too) found that  which your Lord promised the Truth ? They say: Yea, verily. And a crier in between  them crieth: The curse of Allah is on evil-doers, 
7|45|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Who debar (men) from the path of Allah and would have it crooked, and who  are disbelievers in the Last Day. 
7|46|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Between them is a veil. And on the Heights are men who know them all by  their marks. And they call unto the dwellers of the Garden: Peace be unto you! They  enter it not although they hope (to enter). 
7|47|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when their eyes are turned toward the dwellers of the Fire, they say: Our  Lord! Place us not with the wrong-doing folk. 
7|48|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the dwellers on the Heights call unto men whom they know by their  marks, (saying): What did your multitude and that in which ye took your pride avail  you ? 
7|49|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Are these they of whom ye swore that Allah would not show them mercy ?  (Unto them it hath been said): Enter the Garden. No fear shall come upon you nor is it  ye who will grieve. 
7|50|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the dwellers of the Fire cry out unto the dwellers of the Garden: Pour on  us some water or some wherewith Allah hath provided you. They say: Lo! Allah hath  forbidden both to disbelievers (in His guidance), 
7|51|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Who took their religion for a sport and pastime, and whom the life of the  world beguiled. So this day We have forgotten them even as they forgot the meeting  of this their Day and as they used to deny Our tokens. 
7|52|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Verily We have brought them a Scripture which We expounded with  knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe. 
7|53|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Await they aught save the fulfilment thereof ? On the day when the  fulfilment thereof cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof will say: The  messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth! Have we any intercessors, that they may  intercede for us ? Or can we be returned (to life on earth), that we may act otherwise  than we used to act ? They have lost their souls, and that which they devised hath  failed them. 
7|54|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,  then mounted He the Throne. He covereth the night with the day, which is in haste to  follow it, and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His  command. His verily is all creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of  the Worlds! 
7|55|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|(O mankind!) Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. Lo! He loveth not  aggressors. 
7|56|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering (thereof). and call on  Him in fear and hope. Lo! the mercy of Allah is nigh unto the good. 
7|57|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And He it is Who sendeth the winds as tidings heralding His mercy, till,  when they bear a cloud heavy (with rain), We lead it to a dead land, and then cause  water to descend thereon and thereby bring forth fruits of every kind. Thus bring We  forth the dead. Haply ye may remember. 
7|58|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|As for the good land, its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord;  while as for that which is bad, only the useless cometh forth (from it). Thus do We  recount the tokens for people who give thanks. 
7|59|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|We sent Noah (of old) unto his people, and he said: O my people! Serve  Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an Awful  Day. 
7|60|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chieftains of his people said: Lo! we see thee surely in plain error. 
7|61|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a messenger from  the Lord of the Worlds. 
7|62|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and give good counsel unto you,  and know from Allah that which ye know not. 
7|63|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by  means of a man among you, that he may warn you, and that ye may keep from evil,  and that haply ye may find mercy. 
7|64|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and  We drowned those who denied Our tokens. Lo! they were blind folk. 
7|65|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And unto (the tribe of) A'ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said: O my  people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
7|66|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chieftains of his people, who were disbelieving, said: Lo! we surely see  thee in foolishness, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. 
7|67|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: O my people! There is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger  from the Lord of the Worlds. 
7|68|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true adviser. 
7|69|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by  means of a man among you, that he may warn you ? Remember how He made you  viceroys after Noah's folk, and gave you growth of stature. Remember (all) the  bounties of your Lord, that haply ye may be successful. 
7|70|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said: Hast come unto us that we should serve Allah alone, and forsake  what our fathers worshipped ? Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us  if thou art of the truthful! 
7|71|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Terror and wrath from your Lord have already fallen on you. Would  ye wrangle with me over names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which  no warrant from Allah hath been revealed ? Then await (the consequence), lo! I (also)  am of those awaiting (it). 
7|72|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We saved him and those with him by a mercy from Us, and We cut the  root of those who denied Our revelations and were not believers. 
7|73|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And to (the tribe of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my  people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. A wonder from your Lord hath  come unto you. Lo! this is the camel of Allah, a token unto you; so let her feed in  Allah's earth, and touch her not with hurt lest painful torment seize you. 
7|74|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And remember how He made you viceroys after A'ad and gave you station in  the earth. Ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings. So  remember (all) the bounties of Allah and do not evil, making mischief in the earth. 
7|75|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chieftains of his people, who were scornful, said unto those whom they  despised, unto such of them as believed: Know ye that Salih is one sent from his Lord  ? They said: Lo! In that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers. 
7|76|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Those who were scornful said: Lo! in that which ye believe we are  disbelievers. 
7|77|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So they hamstrung the she-camel, and they flouted the commandment of  their Lord, and they said: O Salih! Bring upon us that thou threatenest if thou art  indeed of those sent (from Allah). 
7|78|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So the earthquake seized them, and morning found them prostrate in their  dwelling-place. 
7|79|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And (Salih) turned from them and said: O my people! I delivered my Lord's  message unto you and gave you good advice, but ye love not good advisers. 
7|80|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit  abomination such as no creature ever did before you ? 
7|81|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! ye come with lust unto men instead of women. Nay, but ye are wanton  folk. 
7|82|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the answer of his people was only that they said (one to another): Turn  them out of your township. They are folk, forsooth, who keep pure. 
7|83|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We rescued him and his household, save his wife, who was of those  who stayed behind. 
7|84|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We rained a rain upon them. See now the nature of the consequence of  evil-doers! 
7|85|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And unto Midian (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb. He said: O my people!  Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Lo! a clear proof hath come unto you  from your Lord; so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind in their  goods, and work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof. That will be  better for you, if ye are believers. 
7|86|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lurk not on every road to threaten (wayfarers), and to turn away from Allah's  path him who believeth in Him, and to seek to make it crooked. And remember, when  ye were but few, how He did multiply you. And see the nature of the consequence for  the corrupters! 
7|87|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And if there is a party of you which believeth in that wherewith I have been  sent, and there is a party which believeth not, then have patience until Allah judge  between us. He is the Best of all who deal in judgment. 
7|88|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chieftains of his people, who were scornful, said: Surely we will drive  thee out, O Shu'eyb, and those who believe with thee, from our township, unless ye  return to our religion. He said: Even though we hate it ? 
7|89|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|We should have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion  after Allah hath rescued us from it. It is not for us to return to it unless Allah our Lord  should (so) will. Our Lord comprehendeth all things in knowledge. In Allah do we  put our trust. Our Lord! Decide with truth between us and our folk, for Thou art the  best of those who make decision. 
7|90|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But the chieftains of his people, who were disbelieving, said: If ye follow  Shu'eyb, then truly ye shall be the losers. 
7|91|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their  dwelling-place. 
7|92|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Those who denied Shu'eyb became as though they had not dwelt there. Those  who denied Shu'eyb, they were the losers. 
7|93|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So he turned from them and said: O my people! I delivered my Lord's  messages unto you and gave you good advice; then how can I sorrow for a people that  rejected (truth) ? 
7|94|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We sent no prophet unto any township but We did afflict its folk with  tribulation and adversity that haply they might grow humble. 
7|95|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then changed We the evil plight for good till they grew affluent and said:  Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers. Then We seized them unawares, when  they perceived not. 
7|96|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil, surely  We should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth. But (unto  every messenger) they gave the lie, and so We seized them on account of what they  used to earn. 
7|97|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath  upon them as a night-raid while they sleep ? 
7|98|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Or are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath  upon them in the daytime while they play ? 
7|99|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Are they then secure from Allah's scheme ? None deemeth himself secure  from Allah's scheme save folk that perish. 
7|100|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Is it not an indication to those who inherit the land after its people (who thus  reaped the consequence of evil-doing) that, if We will, We can smite them for their  sins and print upon their hearts so that they hear not ? 
7|101|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Such were the townships. We relate some tidings of them unto thee  (Muhammad). Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty), but they could not believe because they had before denied. Thus doth  Allah print upon the hearts of disbelievers (that they hear not). 
7|102|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|We found no (loyalty to any) covenant in most of them. Nay, most of them  We found wrong-doers. 
7|103|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then, after them, We sent Moses with our tokens unto Pharaoh and his  chiefs, but they repelled them. Now, see the nature of the consequence for the  corrupters! 
7|104|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Moses said: O Pharaoh! Lo! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds, 
7|105|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Approved upon condition that I speak concerning Allah nothing but the truth.  I come unto you (lords of Egypt) with a clear proof from your Lord. So let the  Children of Israel go with me. 
7|106|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|(Pharaoh) said: If thou comest with a token, then produce it, if thou art of  those who speak the truth. 
7|107|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then he flung down his staff and lo! it was a serpent manifest; 
7|108|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And he drew forth his hand (from his bosom), and lo! it was white for the  beholders. 
7|109|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Lo! this is some knowing wizard, 
7|110|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Who would expel you from your land. Now what do ye advise ? 
7|111|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said (unto Pharaoh): Put him off (a while) - him and his brother - and  send into the cities summoners, 
7|112|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|To bring each knowing wizard unto thee. 
7|113|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the wizards came to Pharaoh, saying: Surely there will be a reward for  us if we are victors. 
7|114|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He answered: Yes, and surely ye shall be of those brought near (to me). 
7|115|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said: O Moses! Either throw (first) or let us be the first throwers ? 
7|116|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Throw! And when they threw they cast a spell upon the people's  eyes, and overawed them, and produced a mighty spell. 
7|117|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We inspired Moses (saying): Throw thy staff! And lo! it swallowed up  their lying show. 
7|118|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Thus was the Truth vindicated and that which they were doing was made  vain. 
7|119|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Thus were they there defeated and brought low. 
7|120|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the wizards fell down prostrate, 
7|121|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, 
7|122|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The Lord of Moses and Aaron. 
7|123|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Pharaoh said: Ye believe in Him before I give you leave! Lo! this is the plot  that ye have plotted in the city that ye may drive its people hence. But ye shall come  to know! 
7|124|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Surely I shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides. Then I  shall crucify you every one. 
7|125|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said: Lo! We are about to return unto our Lord! 
7|126|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Thou takest vengeance on us only forasmuch as we believed the tokens of  our Lord when they came unto us. Our Lord! Vouchsafe unto us steadfastness and  make us die as men who have surrendered (unto Thee). 
7|127|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: (O King), wilt thou suffer Moses and his  people to make mischief in the land, and flout thee and thy gods ? He said: We will  slay their sons and spare their women, for lo! we are in power over them. 
7|128|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And Moses said unto his people: Seek help in Allah and endure. Lo! the  earth is Allah's. He giveth it for an inheritance to whom He will. And lo! the sequel is  for those who keep their duty (unto Him). 
7|129|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They said: We suffered hurt before thou camest unto us, and since thou hast  come unto us. He said: It may be that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary  and make you viceroys in the earth, that He may see how ye behave. 
7|130|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And we straitened Pharaoh's folk with famine and dearth of fruits, that  peradventure they might heed. 
7|131|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But whenever good befell them, they said: This is ours; and whenever evil  smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with him. Surely  their evil auspice was only with Allah. But most of them knew not. 
7|132|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And they said: Whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us, we  shall not put faith in thee. 
7|133|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So We sent against them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the  frogs and the blood - a succession of clear signs. But they were arrogant and became a  guilty folk. 
7|134|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when the terror fell on them they cried: O Moses! Pray for us unto thy  Lord, because He hath a covenant with thee. If thou removest the terror from us we  verily will trust thee and will let the Children of Israel go with thee. 
7|135|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But when We did remove from them the terror for a term which they must  reach, behold! they broke their covenant. 
7|136|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Therefore We took retribution from them; therefore We drowned them in the  sea: because they denied Our revelations and were heedless of them. 
7|137|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of the  land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed. And the fair word of thy  Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance; and We  annihilated (all) that Pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had contrived. 
7|138|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came unto a  people who were given up to idols which they had. They said: O Moses! Make for us  a god even as they have gods. He said: Lo! ye are a folk who know not. 
7|139|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! as for these, their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing is in  vain. 
7|140|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah when He hath favoured  you above (all) creatures ? 
7|141|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk who were  afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women.   That was a tremendous trial from your Lord. 
7|142|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights (of solitude), and added to  them ten, and he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights; and  Moses said unto his brother, Aaron: Take my place among the people. Do right, and  follow not the way of mischief-makers. 
7|143|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto  him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thy Self), that I may gaze upon Thee. He said:  Thou wilt not see Me, but gaze upon the mountain! If it stand still in its place, then  thou wilt see Me. And when his Lord revealed (His) glory to the mountain He sent it  crashing down. And Moses fell down senseless. And when he woke he said: Glory  unto Thee! I turn unto Thee repentant, and I am the first of (true) believers. 
7|144|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and  by My speaking (unto thee). So hold that which I have given thee, and be among the  thankful. 
7|145|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson to be drawn from all  things and the explanation of all things, then (bade him): Hold it fast; and command  thy people (saying): Take the better (course made clear) therein. I shall show thee the  abode of evil-livers. 
7|146|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|I shall turn away from My revelations those who magnify themselves  wrongfully in the earth, and if they see each token believe it not, and if they see the  way of righteousness choose it nor for (their) way, and if they see the way of error  choose if for (their) way. That is because they deny Our revelations and are used to  disregard them. 
7|147|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, their  works are fruitless. Are they requited aught save what they used to do ? 
7|148|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And the folk of Moses, after (he left them), chose a calf (for worship),  (made) out of their ornaments, of saffron hue, which gave a lowing sound. Saw they  not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way ? They chose it, and  became wrong-doers. 
7|149|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone  astray, they said: Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us, we verily are of  the lost. 
7|150|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved, he said: Evil  is that (course) which ye took after I had left you. Would ye hasten on the judgment  of your Lord ? And he cast down the tablets, and he seized his brother by the head,  dragging him toward him. He said: Son of my mother! Lo! the folk did judge me  weak and almost killed me. Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph over me and place  me not among the evil-doers. 
7|151|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He said: My Lord! Have mercy on me and on my brother; bring us into Thy  mercy, Thou the Most Merciful of all who show mercy. 
7|152|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! Those who chose the calf (for worship), terror from their Lord and  humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world. Thus do We requite those  who invent a lie. 
7|153|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But those who do ill-deeds and afterward repent and believe - lo! for them,  afterward, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
7|154|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Then, when the anger of Moses abated, he took up the tablets, and in their  inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their Lord. 
7|155|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and,  when the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst  destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which  the ignorant among us did ? It is but Thy trial (of us). Thou sendest whom Thou wilt  astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive  us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness. 
7|156|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter (that  which is good), Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My punishment  whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain it for those  who ward off (evil) and pay the poor-due, and those who believe Our revelations; 
7|157|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Those who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor  write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with  them. He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong.  He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and  he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear. Then those  who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow the light which is sent  down with him: they are the successful. 
7|158|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Say (O Muhammad): O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all  - (the messenger of) Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and  the earth. There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So believe  in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who  believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led aright. 
7|159|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And of Moses' folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish  justice therewith. 
7|160|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We inspired Moses, when  his people asked him for water, saying: Smite with thy staff the rock! And there  gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinking-place.  And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them the  manna and the quails (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith we have provided  you. They wronged Us not, but they were wont to wrong themselves. 
7|161|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when it was said unto them: Dwell in this township and eat therefrom  whence ye will, and say "Repentance," and enter the gate prostrate; We shall forgive  you your sins; We shall increase (reward) for the right-doers. 
7|162|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But those of them who did wrong changed the word which had been told  them for another saying, and We sent down upon them wrath from heaven for their  wrongdoing. 
7|163|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Ask them (O Muhammad) of the township that was by the sea, how they did  break the Sabbath, how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their Sabbath day  and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them. Thus did We  try them for that they were evil-livers. 
7|164|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when a community among them said: Why preach ye to a folk whom  Allah is about to destroy or punish with an awful doom, they said: In order to be free  from guilt before your Lord, and that haply they may ward off (evil). 
7|165|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded, We rescued  those who forbade wrong, and visited those who did wrong with dreadful punishment  because they were evil-livers. 
7|166|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|So when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden, We said unto  them: Be ye apes despised and loathed! 
7|167|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And (remember) when thy Lord proclaimed that He would raise against them  till the Day of Resurrection those who would lay on them a cruel torment. Lo! verily  thy Lord is swift in prosecution and lo! verily He is Forgiving, Merciful. 
7|168|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And We have sundered them in the earth as (separate) nations. Some of them  are righteous, and some far from that. And We have tried them with good things and  evil things that haply they might return. 
7|169|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And a generation hath succeeded them who inherited the scriptures. They  grasp the goods of this low life (as the price of evil-doing) and say: It will be forgiven  us. And if there came to them (again) the offer of the like, they would accept it (and  would sin again). Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf  that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the truth ? And they have  studied that which is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better, for those who  ward off (evil). Have ye then no sense ? 
7|170|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And as for those who make (men) keep the Scripture, and establish worship -  lo! We squander not the wages of reformers. 
7|171|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when We shook the Mount above them as it were a covering, and they  supposed that it was going to fall upon them (and We said): Hold fast that which We  have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil). 
7|172|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And (remember) when thy Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam,  from their reins, their seed, and made them testify of themselves, (saying): Am I not  your Lord ? They said: Yea, verily. We testify. (That was) lest ye should say at the  Day of Resurrection: Lo! of this we were unaware; 
7|173|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Or lest ye should say: (It is) only (that) our fathers ascribed partners to Allah  of old and we were (their) seed after them. Wilt Thou destroy us on account of that  which those who follow falsehood did ? 
7|174|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Thus we detail the revelations, that haply they may return. 
7|175|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Recite unto them the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations, but he  sloughed them off, so Satan overtook him and he became of those who lead astray. 
7|176|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And had We willed We could have raised him by their means, but he clung  to the earth and followed his own lust. Therefor his likeness is as the likeness of a  dog: if thou attackest him he panteth with his tongue out, and if thou leavest him he  panteth with his tongue out. Such is the likeness of the people who deny Our  revelations. Narrate unto them the history (of the men of old), that haply they may  take thought. 
7|177|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Evil as an example are the folk who denied Our revelations, and were wont  to wrong themselves. 
7|178|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He whom Allah leadeth, he indeed is led aright, while he whom Allah  sendeth astray - they indeed are losers. 
7|179|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Already have We urged unto hell many of the jinn and humankind, having  hearts wherewith they understand not, and having eyes wherewith they see not, and  having ears wherewith they hear not. These are as the cattle - nay, but they are worse!  These are the neglectful. 
7|180|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Allah's are the fairest names. Invoke Him by them. And leave the company  of those who blaspheme His names. They will be requited what they do. 
7|181|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And of those whom We created there is a nation who guide with the Truth  and establish justice therewith. 
7|182|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And those who deny Our revelations - step by step We lead them on from  whence they know not. 
7|183|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|I give them rein (for) lo! My scheme is strong. 
7|184|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Have they not bethought them (that) there is no madness in their comrade ?  He is but a plain warner. 
7|185|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Have they not considered the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and  what things Allah hath created, and that it may be that their own term draweth nigh ?  In what fact after this will they believe ? 
7|186|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Those whom Allah sendeth astray, there is no guide for them. He leaveth  them to wander blindly on in their contumacy. 
7|187|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They ask thee of the (destined) Hour, when will it come to port. Say:  Knowledge thereof is with my Lord only. He alone will manifest it at its proper time.  It is heavy in the heavens and the earth. It cometh not to you save unawares. They  question thee as if thou couldst be well informed thereof. Say: Knowledge thereof is  with Allah only, but most of mankind know not. 
7|188|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Say: For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to hurt, save that  which Allah willeth. Had I knowledge of the Unseen, I should have abundance of  wealth, and adversity would not touch me. I am but a warner, and a bearer of good  tidings unto folk who believe. 
7|189|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|He it is Who did create you from a single soul, and therefrom did make his  mate that he might take rest in her. And when he covered her she bore a light burden,  and she passed (unnoticed) with it, but when it became heavy they cried unto Allah,  their Lord, saying: If thou givest unto us aright we shall be of the thankful. 
7|190|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|But when He gave unto them aright, they ascribed unto Him partners in  respect of that which He had given them. High is He Exalted above all that they  associate (with Him). 
7|191|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Attribute they as partners to Allah those who created naught, but are  themselves created, 
7|192|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And cannot give them help, nor can they help themselves ? 
7|193|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And if ye call them to the Guidance, they follow you not. Whether ye call  them or are silent is all one for you. 
7|194|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! those on whom ye call beside Allah are slaves like unto you. Call on  them now, and let them answer you, if ye are truthful! 
7|195|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they  hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear ?  Say: Call upon your (so-called) partners (of Allah), and then contrive against me,  spare me not! 
7|196|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! my Protecting Friend is Allah Who revealeth the Scripture. He  befriendeth the righteous. 
7|197|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|They on whom ye call beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they  help you, nor can they help themselves. 
7|198|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And if ye (Muslims) call them to the guidance they hear not; and thou  (Muhammad) seest them looking toward thee, but they see not. 
7|199|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Keep to forgiveness (O Muhammad), and enjoin kindness, and turn away  from the ignorant. 
7|200|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And if a slander from the devil wound thee, then seek refuge in Allah. Lo!  He is Hearer, Knower. 
7|201|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! those who ward off (evil), when a glamour from the devil troubleth  them, they do but remember (Allah's Guidance) and behold them seers! 
7|202|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Their brethren plunge them further into error and cease not. 
7|203|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when thou bringest not a verse for them they say: Why hast thou not  chosen it ? Say: I follow only that which is inspired in me from my Lord. This  (Qur'an) is insight from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people that  believe. 
7|204|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And when the Qur'an is recited, give ear to it and pay heed, that ye may  obtain mercy. 
7|205|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|And do thou (O Muhammad) remember thy Lord within thyself humbly and  with awe, below thy breath, at morn and evening. And be not thou of the neglectful. 
7|206|al-A`raf: The Elevated Places|Lo! those who are with thy Lord are not too proud to do Him service, but  they praise Him and adore Him. 
8|1|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|They ask thee (O Muhammad) of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war  belong to Allah and the messenger, so keep your duty to Allah, and adjust the matter  of your difference, and obey Allah and His messenger, if ye are (true) believers. 
8|2|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|They only are the (true) believers whose hearts feel fear when Allah is  mentioned, and when His revelations are recited unto them they increase their faith,  and who trust in their Lord; 
8|3|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Who establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed on them. 
8|4|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Those are they who are in truth believers. For them are grades (of honour)  with their Lord, and pardon, and a bountiful provision. 
8|5|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Even as thy Lord caused thee (Muhammad) to go forth from thy home with  the Truth, and lo! a party of the believers were averse (to it). 
8|6|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Disputing with thee of the Truth after it had been made manifest, as if they  were being driven to death visible. 
8|7|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when Allah promised you one of the two bands (of the enemy) that it  should be yours, and ye longed that other than the armed one might be yours. And  Allah willed that He should cause the Truth to triumph by His words, and cut the root  of the disbelievers; 
8|8|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That He might cause the Truth to triumph and bring vanity to naught,  however much the guilty might oppose; 
8|9|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When ye sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): I will help  you with a thousand of the angels, rank on rank. 
8|10|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Allah appointed it only as good tidings, and that your hearts thereby might be  at rest. Victory cometh only by the help of Allah. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
8|11|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When He made the slumber fall upon you as a reassurance from him and sent  down water from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you, and remove  from you the fear of Satan, and make strong your hearts and firm (your) feet thereby. 
8|12|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those  who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Then  smite the necks and smite of them each finger. 
8|13|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger. Whoso opposeth  Allah and His messenger, (for him) lo! Allah is severe in punishment. 
8|14|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That (is the award), so taste it, and (know) that for disbelievers is the torment  of the Fire. 
8|15|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not  your backs to them. 
8|16|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or  intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation  will be hell, a hapless journey's end. 
8|17|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Ye (Muslims) slew them not, but Allah slew them. And thou (Muhammad)  threwest not when thou didst throw, but Allah threw, that He might test the believers  by a fair test from Him. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
8|18|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That (is the case); and (know) that Allah (it is) Who maketh weak the plan of  disbelievers. 
8|19|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|(O Qureysh!) If ye sought a judgment, now hath the judgment come unto  you. And if ye cease (from persecuting the believers) it will be better for you, but if  ye return (to the attack) We also shall return. And your host will avail you naught,  however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers (in His  Guidance). 
8|20|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His messenger, and turn not away from  him when ye hear (him speak). 
8|21|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Be not as those who say, we hear, and they hear not. 
8|22|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Lo! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the deaf, the dumb, who have no  sense. 
8|23|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Had Allah known of any good in them He would have made them hear, but  had He made them hear they would have turned away, averse. 
8|24|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He calleth you to  that which quickeneth you, and know that Allah cometh in between the man and his  own heart, and that He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered. 
8|25|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And guard yourselves against a chastisement which cannot fall exclusively  on those of you who are wrong-doers, and know that Allah is severe in punishment. 
8|26|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And remember, when ye were few and reckoned feeble in the land, and were  in fear lest men should extirpate you, how He gave you refuge, and strengthened you  with His help, and made provision of good things for you, that haply ye might be  thankful. 
8|27|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! Betray not Allah and His messenger, nor knowingly  betray your trusts. 
8|28|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And know that your possessions and your children are a test, and that with  Allah is immense reward. 
8|29|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! If ye keep your duty to Allah, He will give you  discrimination (between right and wrong) and will rid you of your evil thoughts and  deeds, and will forgive you. Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
8|30|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when those who disbelieve plot against thee (O Muhammad) to wound  thee fatally, or to kill thee or to drive thee forth; they plot, but Allah (also) plotteth;  and Allah is the best of plotters. 
8|31|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when Our revelations are recited unto them they say: We have heard. If  we wish we can speak the like of this. Lo! this is naught but fables of the men of old. 
8|32|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when they said: O Allah! If this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain  down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom! 
8|33|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|But Allah would not punish them while thou wast with them, nor will He  punish them while they seek forgiveness. 
8|34|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|What (plea) have they that Allah should not punish them, when they debar  (His servants) from the Inviolable Place of Worship, though they are not its fitting  guardians. Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to Allah. But most  of them know not. 
8|35|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And their worship at the (holy) House is naught but whistling and hand- clapping. Therefore (it is said unto them): Taste of the doom because ye disbelieve. 
8|36|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Lo! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar  (men) from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for  them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto  hell, 
8|37|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That Allah may separate the wicked from the good, The wicked will He  place piece upon piece, and heap them all together, and consign them unto hell. Such  verily are the losers. 
8|38|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Tell those who disbelieve that if they cease (from persecution of believers)  that which is past will be forgiven them; but if they return (thereto) then the example  of the men of old hath already gone (before them, for a warning). 
8|39|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But  if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do. 
8|40|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Befriender - a  Transcendent Patron, a Transcendent Helper! 
8|41|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And know that whatever ye take as spoils of war, lo! a fifth thereof is for  Allah, and for the messenger and for the kinsman (who hath need) and orphans and  the needy and the wayfarer, if ye believe in Allah and that which We revealed unto  Our slave on the Day of Discrimination, the day when the two armies met. And Allah  is Able to do all things. 
8|42|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When ye were on the near bank (of the valley) and they were on the yonder  bank, and the caravan was below you (on the coast plain). And had ye trysted to meet  one another ye surely would have failed to keep the tryst, but (it happened, as it did,  without the forethought of either of you) that Allah might conclude a thing that must  be done; that he who perished (on that day) might perish by a clear proof (of His  Sovereignty) and he who survived might survive by a clear proof (of His  Sovereignty). Lo! Allah in truth is Hearer, Knower. 
8|43|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When Allah showed them unto thee (O Muhammad) in thy dream as few in  number, and if He had shown them to thee as many, ye (Muslims) would have  faltered and would have quarrelled over the affair. But Allah saved (you). Lo! He  knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). 
8|44|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when He made you (Muslims), when ye met (them), see them with your  eyes as few, and lessened you in their eyes, (it was) that Allah might conclude a thing  that must be done. Unto Allah all things are brought back. 
8|45|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O ye who believe! When ye meet an army, hold firm and think of Allah  much, that ye may be successful. 
8|46|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And obey Allah and His messenger, and dispute not one with another lest ye  falter and your strength depart from you; but be steadfast! Lo! Allah is with the  steadfast. 
8|47|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully and to be  seen of men, and debar (men) from the way of Allah, while Allah is surrounding all  they do. 
8|48|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And when Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said: No-one of  mankind can conquer you this day, for I am your protector. But when the armies came  in sight of one another, he took flight, saying: Lo! I am guiltless of you. Lo! I see that  which ye see not. Lo! I fear Allah. And Allah is severe in punishment. 
8|49|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said: Their  religion hath deluded these. Whoso putteth his trust in Allah (will find that) lo! Allah  is Mighty, Wise. 
8|50|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|If thou couldst see how the angels receive those who disbelieve, smiting  faces and their backs and (saying): Taste the punishment of burning! 
8|51|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|This is for that which your own hands have sent before (to the Judgment),  and (know) that Allah is not a tyrant to His slaves. 
8|52|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|(Their way is) as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they  disbelieved the revelations of Allah, and Allah took them in their sins. Lo! Allah is  Strong, severe in punishment. 
8|53|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|That is because Allah never changeth the grace He hath bestowed on any  people until they first change that which is in their hearts, and (that is) because Allah  is Hearer, Knower. 
8|54|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|(Their way is) as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they  denied the revelations of their Lord, so We destroyed them in their sins. And We  drowned the folk of Pharaoh. All were evil-doers. 
8|55|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Lo! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the ungrateful who will not  believe. 
8|56|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Those of them with whom thou madest a treaty, and then at every  opportunity they break their treaty, and they keep not duty (to Allah). 
8|57|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those  who are behind them, that haply they may remember. 
8|58|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And if thou fearest treachery from any folk, then throw back to them (their  treaty) fairly. Lo! Allah loveth not the treacherous. 
8|59|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's  Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape. 
8|60|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered,  that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside  them whom ye know not. Allah knoweth them. Whatsoever ye spend in the way of  Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. 
8|61|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah. Lo!  He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower. 
8|62|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And if they would deceive thee, then lo! Allah is Sufficient for thee. He it is  Who supporteth thee with His help and with the believers, 
8|63|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And (as for the believers) hath attuned their hearts. If thou hadst spent all that  is in the earth thou couldst not have attuned their hearts, but Allah hath attuned them.  Lo! He is Mighty, Wise. 
8|64|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O Prophet! Allah is Sufficient for thee and those who follow thee of the  believers. 
8|65|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty steadfast  they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a hundred (steadfast) they  shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers)  are a folk without intelligence. 
8|66|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Now hath Allah lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is  weakness in you. So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two  hundred, and if there be of you a thousand (steadfast) they shall overcome two  thousand by permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast. 
8|67|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the  land. Ye desire the lure of this world and Allah desireth (for you) the Hereafter, and  Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
8|68|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Had it not been for an ordinance of Allah which had gone before, an awful  doom had come upon you on account of what ye took. 
8|69|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to  Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
8|70|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|O Prophet! Say unto those captives who are in your hands: If Allah knoweth  any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken from  you, and will forgive you. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
8|71|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And if they would betray thee, they betrayed Allah before, and He gave  (thee) power over them. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
8|72|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and  their lives for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them: these  are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their  homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek  help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help (them) except  against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
8|73|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If ye do not so,  there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption. 
8|74|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of Allah,  and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. For  them is pardon, and bountiful provision. 
8|75|al-Anfal: The Spoils Of War|And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along  with you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the  ordinance of Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things. 
9|1|at-Taubah: Repentance|Freedom from obligation (is proclaimed) from Allah and His messenger  toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty. 
9|2|at-Taubah: Repentance|Travel freely in the land four months, and know that ye cannot escape Allah  and that Allah will confound the disbelievers (in His Guidance). 
9|3|at-Taubah: Repentance|And a proclamation from Allah and His messenger to all men on the day of  the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters, and (so is)  His messenger. So, if ye repent, it will be better for you; but if ye are averse, then  know that ye cannot escape Allah. Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to  those who disbelieve, 
9|4|at-Taubah: Repentance|Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye (Muslims) have a treaty, and  who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you.  (As for these), fulfil their treaty to them till their term. Lo! Allah loveth those who  keep their duty (unto Him). 
9|5|at-Taubah: Repentance|Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye  find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each  ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave  their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
9|6|at-Taubah: Repentance|And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection (O Muhammad), then  protect him so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and afterward convey him to his  place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not. 
9|7|at-Taubah: Repentance|How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the  idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship ?  So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their  duty. 
9|8|at-Taubah: Repentance|How (can there be any treaty for the others) when, if they have the upper  hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you ? They satisfy you with  their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are wrongdoers. 
9|9|at-Taubah: Repentance|They have purchased with the revelations of Allah a little gain, so they debar  (men) from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do. 
9|10|at-Taubah: Repentance|And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they  who are transgressors. 
9|11|at-Taubah: Repentance|But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they  your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have  knowledge. 
9|12|at-Taubah: Repentance|And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you)  and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding  oaths - in order that they may desist. 
9|13|at-Taubah: Repentance|Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to  drive out the messenger and did attack you first ? What! Fear ye them ? Now Allah  hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers 
9|14|at-Taubah: Repentance|Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low  and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are  believers. 
9|15|at-Taubah: Repentance|And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah relenteth toward whom  He will. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
9|16|at-Taubah: Repentance|Or deemed ye that ye would be left (in peace) when Allah yet knoweth not  those of you who strive, choosing for familiar none save Allah and His messenger and  the believers ? Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
9|17|at-Taubah: Repentance|It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah's sanctuaries, bearing witness against  themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will  abide. 
9|18|at-Taubah: Repentance|He only shall tend Allah's sanctuaries who believeth in Allah and the Last  Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save  Allah. For such (only) is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided. 
9|19|at-Taubah: Repentance|Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place  of Worship as (equal to the worth of) him who believeth in Allah and the Last Day,  and striveth in the way of Allah ? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. Allah  guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
9|20|at-Taubah: Repentance|Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth  and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are  they who are triumphant. 
9|21|at-Taubah: Repentance|Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance,  and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs; 
9|22|at-Taubah: Repentance|There they will abide for ever. Lo! with Allah there is immense reward. 
9|23|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if  they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends,  such are wrong-doers. 
9|24|at-Taubah: Repentance|Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and  your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear that  there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than Allah and His  messenger and striving in His way: then wait till Allah bringeth His command to pass.  Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
9|25|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when  ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as it is, was  straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight; 
9|26|at-Taubah: Repentance|Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and  upon the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who  disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 
9|27|at-Taubah: Repentance|Then afterward Allah will relent toward whom He will; for Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
9|28|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near  the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss  of their merchandise) Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! Allah is  Knower, Wise. 
9|29|at-Taubah: Repentance|Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not  in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His  messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily,  being brought low. 
9|30|at-Taubah: Repentance|And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The  Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the  saying of those who disbelieved of old. Allah (Himself) fighteth against them. How  perverse are they! 
9|31|at-Taubah: Repentance|They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the  Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God. There is no  God save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! 
9|32|at-Taubah: Repentance|Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah  disdaineth (aught) save that He shall perfect His light, however much the disbelievers  are averse. 
9|33|at-Taubah: Repentance|He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of  Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters  may be averse. 
9|34|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian)  monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar (men) from the way of  Allah. They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah, unto  them give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom, 
9|35|at-Taubah: Repentance|On the day when it will (all) be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads  and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith (and it will be said unto  them): Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what ye used to  hoard. 
9|36|at-Taubah: Repentance|Lo! the number of the months with Allah is twelve months by Allah's  ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are  sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them. And wage war on  all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you. And know that Allah is with  those who keep their duty (unto Him). 
9|37|at-Taubah: Repentance|Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief whereby  those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it (another) year,  that they may make up the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed, so that  they allow that which Allah hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made  fairseeming unto them. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
9|38|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go forth in  the way of Allah, ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness. Take ye pleasure  in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter ? The comfort of the life of the  world is but little in the Hereafter. 
9|39|at-Taubah: Repentance|If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom, and will choose  instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. Allah is Able to do  all things. 
9|40|at-Taubah: Repentance|If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove  him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his  comrade: Grieve not. Lo! Allah is with us. Then Allah caused His peace of  reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and  made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while Allah's Word it was  that became the uppermost. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
9|41|at-Taubah: Repentance|Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your  lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew. 
9|42|at-Taubah: Repentance|Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee, but  the distance seemed too far for them. Yet will they swear by Allah (saying): If we had  been able we would surely have set out with you. They destroy their souls, and Allah  knoweth that they verily are liars. 
9|43|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah forgive thee (O Muhammad)! Wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere  those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars ? 
9|44|at-Taubah: Repentance|Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask no leave of thee lest they  should strive with their wealth and their lives. Allah is Aware of those who keep their  duty (unto Him). 
9|45|at-Taubah: Repentance|They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in Allah and the Last Day, and  whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver. 
9|46|at-Taubah: Repentance|And if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready  some equipment, but Allah was averse to their being sent forth and held them back  and it was said (unto them): Sit ye with the sedentary! 
9|47|at-Taubah: Repentance|Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble  and had hurried to and fro among you, seeking to cause sedition among you; and  among you there are some who would have listened to them. Allah is Aware of evil- doers. 
9|48|at-Taubah: Repentance|Aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee till the  Truth came and the decree of Allah was made manifest, though they were loth. 
9|49|at-Taubah: Repentance|Of them is he who saith: Grant me leave (to stay at home) and tempt me not.  Surely it is into temptation that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! hell verily is all around  the disbelievers. 
9|50|at-Taubah: Repentance|If good befalleth thee (O Muhammad) it afflicteth them, and if calamity  befalleth thee, they say: We took precaution, and they turn away well pleased. 
9|51|at-Taubah: Repentance|Say: Naught befalleth us save that which Allah hath decreed for us. He is our  Protecting Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust! 
9|52|at-Taubah: Repentance|Say: Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things (death or victory  in Allah's way) ? while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doom from  Him or at our hands. Await then! Lo! We are awaiting with you. 
9|53|at-Taubah: Repentance|Say: Pay (your contribution), willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted  from you. Lo! ye were ever froward folk. 
9|54|at-Taubah: Repentance|And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them  save that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His messenger, and they come not to  worship save as idlers, and pay not (their contribution) save reluctantly. 
9|55|at-Taubah: Repentance|So let not their riches nor their children please thee (O Muhammad). Allah  thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall  pass away while they are disbelievers. 
9|56|at-Taubah: Repentance|And they swear by Allah that they are in truth of you, when they are not of  you, but they are folk who are afraid. 
9|57|at-Taubah: Repentance|Had they but found a refuge, or caverns, or a place to enter, they surely had  resorted thither swift as runaways. 
9|58|at-Taubah: Repentance|And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms. If they are  given thereof they are content, and if they are not given thereof, behold! they are  enraged. 
9|59|at-Taubah: Repentance|(How much more seemly) had they been content with that which Allah and  His messenger had given them and had said: Allah sufficeth us. Allah will give us of  His bounty, and (also) His messenger. Unto Allah we are suppliants. 
9|60|at-Taubah: Repentance|The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them,  and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the debtors,  and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is  Knower, Wise. 
9|61|at-Taubah: Repentance|And of them are those who vex the Prophet and say: He is only a hearer. Say:  A hearer of good for you, who believeth in Allah and is true to the believers, and a  mercy for such of you as believe. Those who vex the messenger of Allah, for them  there is a painful doom. 
9|62|at-Taubah: Repentance|They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) to please you, but Allah, with His  messenger, hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers. 
9|63|at-Taubah: Repentance|Know they not that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, his verily is  fire of hell, to abide therein ? That is the extreme abasement. 
9|64|at-Taubah: Repentance|The hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them,  proclaiming what is in their hearts. Say: Scoff (your fill)! Lo! Allah is disclosing what  ye fear. 
9|65|at-Taubah: Repentance|And if thou ask them (O Muhammad) they will say: We did but talk and jest.  Say: Was it at Allah and His revelations and His messenger that ye did scoff ? 
9|66|at-Taubah: Repentance|Make no excuse. Ye have disbelieved after your (confession of) belief. If We  forgive a party of you, a party of you We shall punish because they have been guilty. 
9|67|at-Taubah: Repentance|The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another. They  enjoin the wrong, and they forbid the right, and they withhold their hands (from  spending for the cause of Allah). They forget Allah, so He hath forgotten them. Lo!  the hypocrites, they are the transgressors. 
9|68|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah promiseth the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers  fire of hell for their abode. It will suffice them. Allah curseth them, and theirs is  lasting torment. 
9|69|at-Taubah: Repentance|Even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength, and more  affluent than you in wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot awhile, so ye enjoy  your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile. And ye prate even  as they prated. Such are they whose works have perished in the world and the  Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers. 
9|70|at-Taubah: Repentance|Hath not the fame of those before them reached them - the folk of Noah,  A'ad, Thamud, the folk of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian and the disasters (which  befell them) ? Their messengers (from Allah) came unto them with proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty). So Allah surely wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves. 
9|71|at-Taubah: Repentance|And the believers, men and women, are protecting friends one of another;  they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay  the poor-due, and they obey Allah and His messenger. As for these, Allah will have  mercy on them. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
9|72|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah promiseth to the believers, men and women, Gardens underneath  which rivers flow, wherein they will abide - blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden.  And - greater (far)! - acceptance from Allah. That is the supreme triumph. 
9|73|at-Taubah: Repentance|O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites! Be harsh with  them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey's end. 
9|74|at-Taubah: Repentance|They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong), yet they did say the  word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they  purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that Allah by  His messenger should enrich them of His bounty. If they repent it will be better for  them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world  and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth. 
9|75|at-Taubah: Repentance|And of them is he who made a covenant with Allah (saying): If He give us of  His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous. 
9|76|at-Taubah: Repentance|Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they hoarded it and turned away,  averse; 
9|77|at-Taubah: Repentance|So He hath made the consequence (to be) hypocrisy in their hearts until the  day when they shall meet Him, because they broke their word to Allah that they  promised Him, and because they lied. 
9|78|at-Taubah: Repentance|Know they not that Allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they  confide, and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden ? 
9|79|at-Taubah: Repentance|Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such  as can find naught to give but their endeavours, and deride them - Allah (Himself)  derideth them. Theirs will be a painful doom. 
9|80|at-Taubah: Repentance|Ask forgiveness for them (O Muhammad), or ask not forgiveness for them;  though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them. That  is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and Allah guideth not  wrongdoing folk. 
9|81|at-Taubah: Repentance|Those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of  Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way.  And they said: Go not forth in the heat! Say: The fire of hell is more intense of heat, if  they but understood. 
9|82|at-Taubah: Repentance|Then let them laugh a little: they will weep much, as the reward of what they  used to earn. 
9|83|at-Taubah: Repentance|If Allah bring thee back (from the campaign) unto a party of them and they  ask of thee leave to go out (to fight), then say unto them: Ye shall never more go out  with me nor fight with me against a foe.  Ye were content with sitting still the first  time. So sit still, with the useless. 
9|84|at-Taubah: Repentance|And never (O Muhammad) pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his  grave. Lo! they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and they died while they  were evil-doers. 
9|85|at-Taubah: Repentance|Let not their wealth nor their children please thee! Allah purposeth only to  punish them thereby in the world, and that their souls shall pass away while they are  disbelievers. 
9|86|at-Taubah: Repentance|And when a surah is revealed (which saith): Believe in Allah and strive along  with His messenger, the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee and say:  Suffer us to be with those who sit (at home). 
9|87|at-Taubah: Repentance|They are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are  sealed, so that they apprehend not. 
9|88|at-Taubah: Repentance|But the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth  and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things. Such are they who are the  successful. 
9|89|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow,  wherein they will abide. That is the supreme triumph. 
9|90|at-Taubah: Repentance|And those among the wandering Arabs who had an excuse came in order that  permission might be granted them. And those who lied to Allah and His messenger  sat at home. A painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve. 
9|91|at-Taubah: Repentance|Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to  spend is any fault (to be imputed though they stay at home) if they are true to Allah  and His messenger. Not unto the good is there any road (of blame). Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
9|92|at-Taubah: Repentance|Nor unto those whom, when they came to thee (asking) that thou shouldst  mount them, thou didst tell: I cannot find whereon to mount you. They turned back  with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend. 
9|93|at-Taubah: Repentance|The road (of blame) is only against those who ask for leave of thee (to stay at  home) when they are rich. They are content to be with the useless. Allah hath sealed  their hearts so that they know not. 
9|94|at-Taubah: Repentance|They will make excuse to you (Muslims) when ye return unto them. Say:  Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah hath told us tidings of you. Allah  and His messenger will see your conduct, and then ye will be brought back unto Him  Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used  to do. 
9|95|at-Taubah: Repentance|They will swear by Allah unto you, when ye return unto them, that ye may  let them be. Let them be, for lo! they are unclean, and their abode is hell as the reward  for what they used to earn. 
9|96|at-Taubah: Repentance|They swear unto you, that ye may accept them. Though ye accept them.  Allah verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk. 
9|97|at-Taubah: Repentance|The wandering Arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more  likely to be ignorant of the limits which Allah hath revealed unto His messenger. And  Allah is Knower, Wise. 
9|98|at-Taubah: Repentance|And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth  (for the cause of Allah) as a loss, and awaiteth (evil) turns of fortune for you (that he  may be rid of it). The evil turn of fortune will be theirs. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
9|99|at-Taubah: Repentance|And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in Allah and the Last  Day, and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as  acceptable offerings in the sight of Allah. Lo! verily it is an acceptable offering for  them. Allah will bring them into His mercy. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
9|100|at-Taubah: Repentance|And the first to lead the way, of the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who  followed them in goodness - Allah is well pleased with them and they are well  pleased with Him, and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers  flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph. 
9|101|at-Taubah: Repentance|And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites,  and among the townspeople of Al-Madinah (there are some who) persist in hypocrisy  whom thou (O Muhammad) knowest not. We, We know them, and We shall chastise  them twice; then they will be relegated to a painful doom. 
9|102|at-Taubah: Repentance|And (there are) others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a  righteous action with another that was bad. It may be that Allah will relent toward  them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
9|103|at-Taubah: Repentance|Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst  make them grow, and pray for them. Lo! thy prayer is an assuagement for them. Allah  is Hearer, Knower. 
9|104|at-Taubah: Repentance|Know they not that Allah is He Who accepteth repentance from His  bondmen and taketh the alms, and that Allah is He Who is the Relenting, the  Merciful. 
9|105|at-Taubah: Repentance|And say (unto them): Act! Allah will behold your actions, and (so will) His  messenger and the believers, and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the  Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. 
9|106|at-Taubah: Repentance|And (there are) others who await Allah's decree, whether He will punish  them or will forgive them. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
9|107|at-Taubah: Repentance|And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and  disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as an outpost for  those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime, they will surely swear:  We purposed naught save good. Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. 
9|108|at-Taubah: Repentance|Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty  (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein,  wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers. 
9|109|at-Taubah: Repentance|Is he who founded his building upon duty to Allah and His good pleasure  better; or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling, overhanging  precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell ? Allah guideth not  wrongdoing folk. 
9|110|at-Taubah: Repentance|The building which they built will never cease to be a misgiving in their  hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
9|111|at-Taubah: Repentance|Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because  the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be  slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the  Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah ? Rejoice then in your bargain  that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph. 
9|112|at-Taubah: Repentance|(Triumphant) are those who turn repentant (to Allah), those who serve  (Him), those who praise (Him), those who fast, those who bow down, those who fall  prostrate (in worship), those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those  who keep the limits (ordained) of Allah - And give glad tidings to believers! 
9|113|at-Taubah: Repentance|It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of  idolaters even though they may be near of kin (to them) after it hath become clear that  they are people of hell-fire. 
9|114|at-Taubah: Repentance|The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of  a promise he had promised him, but when it had become clear unto him that he (his  father) was an enemy to Allah he (Abraham) disowned him. Lo! Abraham was soft of  heart, long-suffering. 
9|115|at-Taubah: Repentance|It was never Allah's (part) that He should send a folk astray after He had  guided them until He had made clear unto them what they should avoid. Lo! Allah is  Aware of all things. 
9|116|at-Taubah: Repentance|Lo! Allah! Unto Him belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth.  He quickeneth and He giveth death. And ye have, instead of Allah, no protecting  friend nor helper. 
9|117|at-Taubah: Repentance|Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet, and to the Muhajirin and the  Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship. After the hearts of a party of them  had almost swerved aside, then turned He unto them in mercy. Lo! He is Full of Pity,  Merciful for them. 
9|118|at-Taubah: Repentance|And to the three also (did He turn in mercy) who were left behind, when the  earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for  them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him.  Then turned He unto them in mercy that they (too) might turn (repentant unto Him).  Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. 
9|119|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful. 
9|120|at-Taubah: Repentance|It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the  wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his  life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of  Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor gain they from the  enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor. Lo! Allah loseth not the  wages of the good. 
9|121|at-Taubah: Repentance|Nor spend they any spending, small or great, nor do they cross a valley, but it  is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them the best of what they used to do. 
9|122|at-Taubah: Repentance|And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a  party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may gain sound knowledge  in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they  may beware. 
9|123|at-Taubah: Repentance|O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and  let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty  (unto Him). 
9|124|at-Taubah: Repentance|And whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them who say: Which  one of you hath thus increased in faith ? As for those who believe, it hath increased  them in faith and they rejoice (therefor). 
9|125|at-Taubah: Repentance|But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only addeth wickedness to their  wickedness, and they die while they are disbelievers. 
9|126|at-Taubah: Repentance|See they not that they are tested once or twice in every year ? Still they turn  not in repentance, neither pay they heed. 
9|127|at-Taubah: Repentance|And whenever a surah is revealed, they look one at another (as who should  say): Doth anybody see you ? Then they turn away. Allah turneth away their hearts  because they are a folk who understand not. 
9|128|at-Taubah: Repentance|There hath come unto you a messenger, (one) of yourselves, unto whom  aught that ye are overburdened is grievous, full of concern for you, for the believers  full of pity, merciful. 
9|129|at-Taubah: Repentance|Now, if they turn away (O Muhammad) say: Allah sufficeth me. There is no  God save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous  Throne. 
10|1|Yunus: Jonah|Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Wise Scripture. 
10|2|Yunus: Jonah|Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired a man among them, saying:  Warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have a  sure footing with their Lord ? The disbelievers say: Lo! this is a mere wizard. 
10|3|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,  then He established Himself upon the Throne, directing all things. There is no  intercessor (with Him) save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so  worship Him. Oh, will ye not remind ? 
10|4|Yunus: Jonah|Unto Him is the return of all of you; it is a promise of Allah in truth. Lo! He  produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe and do  good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will be a boiling  drink and painful doom because they disbelieved. 
10|5|Yunus: Jonah|He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light, and  measured for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years, and the  reckoning. Allah created not (all) that save in truth. He detaileth the revelations for  people who have knowledge. 
10|6|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! in the difference of day and night and all that Allah hath created in the  heavens and the earth are portents, verily, for folk who ward off (evil). 
10|7|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! those who expect not the meeting with Us but desire the life of the world  and feel secure therein, and those who are neglectful of Our revelations, 
10|8|Yunus: Jonah|Their home will be the Fire because of what they used to earn. 
10|9|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! those who believe and do good works, their Lord guideth them by their  faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight, 
10|10|Yunus: Jonah|Their prayer therein will be: Glory be to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting  therein will be: Peace. And the conclusion of their prayer will be: Praise be to Allah,  Lord of the Worlds! 
10|11|Yunus: Jonah|If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill (that they have earned) as they  would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We suffer  those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their contumacy. 
10|12|Yunus: Jonah|And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us, (while reclining) on his  side, or sitting or standing, but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth  his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that afflicted him.  Thus is what they do made (seeming) fair unto the prodigal. 
10|13|Yunus: Jonah|We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong; and their  messengers (from Allah) came unto them with clear proofs (of His Sovereignty) but  they would not believe. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. 
10|14|Yunus: Jonah|Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might see  how ye behave. 
10|15|Yunus: Jonah|And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, they who look not for  the meeting with Us say: Bring a Lecture other than this, or change it. Say (O  Muhammad): It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow that which is  inspired in me. Lo! if I disobey my Lord I fear the retribution of an awful Day. 
10|16|Yunus: Jonah|Say: If Allah had so willed I should not have recited it to you nor would He  have made it known to you. I dwelt among you a whole lifetime before it (came to  me). Have ye then no sense ? 
10|17|Yunus: Jonah|Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and  denieth His revelations ? Lo! the guilty never are successful. 
10|18|Yunus: Jonah|They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth  them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Would ye inform  Allah of (something) that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth ?  Praised be  He and High Exalted above all that ye associate (with Him)! 
10|19|Yunus: Jonah|Mankind were but one community; then they differed; and had it not been for  a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it had been judged between them in  respect of that wherein they differ. 
10|20|Yunus: Jonah|And they will say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord!  Then say, (O Muhammad): The Unseen belongeth to Allah. So wait! Lo! I am waiting  with you. 
10|21|Yunus: Jonah|And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which  had afflicted them, behold! they have some plot against Our revelations. Say: Allah is  more swift in plotting. Lo! Our messengers write down that which ye plot. 
10|22|Yunus: Jonah|He it is Who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till, when ye are in the  ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they are glad therein, a storm- wind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and they deem  that they are overwhelmed therein; (then) they cry unto Allah, making their faith pure  for Him only: If Thou deliver us from this, we truly will be of the thankful. 
10|23|Yunus: Jonah|Yet when He hath delivered them, behold! they rebel in the earth wrongfully.  O mankind! Your rebellion is only against yourselves. (Ye have) enjoyment of the  life of the world; then unto Us is your return and We shall proclaim unto you what ye  used to do. 
10|24|Yunus: Jonah|The similitude of the life of the world is only as water which We send down  from the sky, then the earth's growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth with it  till, when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished, and her people  deem that they are masters of her, Our commandment cometh by night or by day and  We make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do we expound  the revelations for people who reflect. 
10|25|Yunus: Jonah|And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace, and leadeth whom He will to a  straight path. 
10|26|Yunus: Jonah|For those who do good is the best (reward) and more (thereto). Neither dust  nor ignominy cometh near their faces. Such are rightful owners of the Garden; they  will abide therein. 
10|27|Yunus: Jonah|And those who earn ill-deeds, (for them) requital of each ill-deed by the like  thereof; and ignominy overtaketh them - They have no protector from Allah - as if  their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night. Such are rightful owners of  the Fire; they will abide therein. 
10|28|Yunus: Jonah|On the day when We gather them all together, then We say unto those who  ascribed partners (unto Us): Stand back, ye and your (pretended) partners (of Allah)!  And We separate them, the one from the other, and their (pretended) partners say: It  was not us ye worshipped. 
10|29|Yunus: Jonah|Allah sufficeth as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of  your worship. 
10|30|Yunus: Jonah|There doth every soul experience that which it did aforetime, and they are  returned unto Allah, their rightful Lord, and that which they used to invent hath failed  them. 
10|31|Yunus: Jonah|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Who provideth for you from the sky and the  earth, or Who owneth hearing and sight; and Who bringeth forth the living from the  dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living; and Who directeth the course ? They  will say: Allah. Then say: Will ye not then keep your duty (unto Him) ? 
10|32|Yunus: Jonah|Such then is Allah, your rightful Lord. After the Truth what is there saving  error ? How then are ye turned away! 
10|33|Yunus: Jonah|Thus is the Word of thy Lord justified concerning those who do wrong: that  they believe not. 
10|34|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Is there of your partners (whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that  produceth Creation and then reproduceth it ? Say: Allah produceth Creation, then  reproduceth it. How then, are ye misled! 
10|35|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Is there of your partners (whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that leadeth  to the Truth ? Say: Allah leadeth to the Truth. Is He Who leadeth to the Truth more  deserving that He should be followed, or he who findeth not the way unless he  (himself) be guided. What aileth you ? How judge ye ? 
10|36|Yunus: Jonah|Most of them follow not but conjecture. Assuredly conjecture can by no  means take the place of truth. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do. 
10|37|Yunus: Jonah|And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be invented in despite of Allah; but  it is a confirmation of that which was before it and an exposition of that which is  decreed for mankind - Therein is no doubt - from the Lord of the Worlds. 
10|38|Yunus: Jonah|Or say they: He hath invented it ? Say: Then bring a surah like unto it, and  call (for help) on all ye can besides Allah, if ye are truthful. 
10|39|Yunus: Jonah|Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass,  and whereof the interpretation (in events) hath not yet come unto them. Even so did  those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the wrong-doers! 
10|40|Yunus: Jonah|And of them is he who believeth therein, and of them is he who believeth not  therein, and thy Lord is Best Aware of the corrupters. 
10|41|Yunus: Jonah|And if they deny thee, say: Unto me my work, and unto you your work. Ye  are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what ye do. 
10|42|Yunus: Jonah|And of them are some who listen unto thee. But canst thou make the deaf to  hear even though they apprehend not ? 
10|43|Yunus: Jonah|And of them is he who looketh toward thee. But canst thou guide the blind  even though they see not ? 
10|44|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves. 
10|45|Yunus: Jonah|And on the day when He shall gather them together, (when it will seem) as  though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognising one another, those will  verily have perished who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided. 
10|46|Yunus: Jonah|Whether We let thee (O Muhammad) behold something of that which We  promise them or (whether We) cause thee to die, still unto Us is their return, and  Allah, moreover, is Witness over what they do. 
10|47|Yunus: Jonah|And for every nation there is a messenger. And when their messenger  cometh (on the Day of Judgment) it will be judged between them fairly, and they will  not be wronged. 
10|48|Yunus: Jonah|And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? 
10|49|Yunus: Jonah|Say: I have no power to hurt or benefit myself, save that which Allah willeth.  For every nation there is an appointed time. When their time cometh, then they cannot  put it off an hour, nor hasten (it). 
10|50|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Have ye thought: When His doom cometh unto you as a raid by night,  or in the (busy) day; what is there of it that the guilty ones desire to hasten ? 
10|51|Yunus: Jonah|Is it (only) then, when it hath befallen you, that ye will believe ? What!  (Believe) now, when (until now) ye have been hastening it on (through disbelief) ? 
10|52|Yunus: Jonah|Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly Taste the torment of  eternity. Are ye requited aught save what ye used to earn ? 
10|53|Yunus: Jonah|And they ask thee to inform them (saying): Is it true ? Say: Yea, by my Lord,  verily it is true, and ye cannot escape. 
10|54|Yunus: Jonah|And if each soul that doeth wrong had all that is in the earth it would seek to  ransom itself therewith; and they will feel remorse within them, when they see the  doom. But it hath been judged between them fairly and they are not wronged. 
10|55|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! verily all that is in the heavens and the earth is Allah's. Lo! verily Allah's  promise is true. But most of them know not. 
10|56|Yunus: Jonah|He quickeneth and giveth death, and unto Him ye will be returned. 
10|57|Yunus: Jonah|O mankind! There hath come unto you an exhortation from your Lord, a  balm for that which is in the breasts, a guidance and a mercy for believers. 
10|58|Yunus: Jonah|Say: In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy: therein let them rejoice. It is  better than what they hoard. 
10|59|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Have ye considered what provision Allah hath sent down for you, how  ye have made of it lawful and unlawful ? Hath Allah permitted you, or do ye invent a  lie concerning Allah ? 
10|60|Yunus: Jonah|And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah (will be their plight)  upon the Day of Resurrection ? Lo! Allah truly is Bountiful toward mankind, but  most of them give not thanks. 
10|61|Yunus: Jonah|And thou (Muhammad) art not occupied with any business and thou recitest  not a Lecture from this (Scripture), and ye (mankind) perform no act, but We are  Witness of you when ye are engaged therein. And not an atom's weight in the earth or  in the sky escapeth your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater than that, but it is  (written) in a clear Book. 
10|62|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! verily the friends of Allah are (those) on whom fear (cometh) not, nor do  they grieve ? 
10|63|Yunus: Jonah|Those who believe and keep their duty (to Allah). 
10|64|Yunus: Jonah|Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter - There is  no changing the Words of Allah - that is the Supreme Triumph. 
10|65|Yunus: Jonah|And let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! power belongeth  wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
10|66|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! is it not unto Allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and  whosoever is in the earth ? Those who follow aught instead of Allah follow not (His)  partners. They follow only a conjecture, and they do but guess. 
10|67|Yunus: Jonah|He it is Who hath appointed for you the night that ye should rest therein and  the day giving sight. Lo! herein verily are portents for a folk that heed. 
10|68|Yunus: Jonah|They say: Allah hath taken (unto Him) a son - Glorified be He! He hath no  needs! His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Ye have no warrant  for this. Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ? 
10|69|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed. 
10|70|Yunus: Jonah|This world's portion (will be theirs), then unto Us is their return. Then We  make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve. 
10|71|Yunus: Jonah|Recite unto them the story of Noah, when he told his people: O my people! If  my sojourn (here) and my reminding you by Allah's revelations are an offence unto  you, in Allah have I put my trust, so decide upon your course of action you and your  partners. Let not your course of action be in doubt for you. Then have at me, give me  no respite. 
10|72|Yunus: Jonah|But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage. My wage is the concern of  Allah only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him). 
10|73|Yunus: Jonah|But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and  made them viceroys (in the earth), while We drowned those who denied Our  revelations. See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned. 
10|74|Yunus: Jonah|Then, after him, We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them  clear proofs. But they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied.  Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors. 
10|75|Yunus: Jonah|Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with  Our revelations, but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk. 
10|76|Yunus: Jonah|And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them, they said: Lo! this  is mere magic. 
10|77|Yunus: Jonah|Moses said: Speak ye (so) of the Truth when it hath come unto you ? Is this  magic ? Now magicians thrive not. 
10|78|Yunus: Jonah|They said: Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we  found our fathers, and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land ? We  will not believe you two. 
10|79|Yunus: Jonah|And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning wizard unto me. 
10|80|Yunus: Jonah|And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast! 
10|81|Yunus: Jonah|And when they had cast, Moses said: That which ye have brought is magic.  Lo! Allah will make it vain. Lo! Allah upholdeth not the work of mischief-makers. 
10|82|Yunus: Jonah|And Allah will vindicate the Truth by His words, however much the guilty  be averse. 
10|83|Yunus: Jonah|But none trusted Moses, save some scions of his people, (and they were) in  fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that he would persecute them. Lo! Pharaoh was  verily a tyrant in the land, and lo! he verily was of the wanton. 
10|84|Yunus: Jonah|And Moses said: O my people! If ye have believed in Allah then put trust in  Him, if ye have indeed surrendered (unto Him)! 
10|85|Yunus: Jonah|They said: In Allah we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the  wrongdoing folk; 
10|86|Yunus: Jonah|And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve. 
10|87|Yunus: Jonah|And We inspired Moses and his brother, (saying): Appoint houses for your  people in Egypt and make your houses oratories, and establish worship. And give  good news to the believers. 
10|88|Yunus: Jonah|And Moses said: Our Lord! Lo! Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs  splendour and riches in the life of the world, Our Lord! that they may lead men astray  from Thy way. Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they  believe not till they see the painful doom. 
10|89|Yunus: Jonah|He said: Your prayer is heard. Do ye twain keep to the straight path, and  follow not the road of those who have no knowledge. 
10|90|Yunus: Jonah|And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his  hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression, till, when the (fate of) drowning  overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no God save Him in Whom the  Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him). 
10|91|Yunus: Jonah|What! Now! When hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrong-doers ? 
10|92|Yunus: Jonah|But this day We save thee in thy body that thou mayst be a portent for those  after thee. Lo! most of mankind are heedless of Our portents. 
10|93|Yunus: Jonah|And We verily did allot unto the Children of Israel a fixed abode, and did  provide them with good things; and they differed not until the knowledge came unto  them. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning  that wherein they used to differ. 
10|94|Yunus: Jonah|And if thou (Muhammad) art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto  thee, then question those who read the Scripture (that was) before thee. Verily the  Truth from thy Lord hath come unto thee. So be not thou of the waverers. 
10|95|Yunus: Jonah|And be not thou of those who deny the revelations of Allah, for then wert  thou of the losers. 
10|96|Yunus: Jonah|Lo! those for whom the word of thy Lord (concerning sinners) hath effect  will not believe, 
10|97|Yunus: Jonah|Though every token come unto them, till they see the painful doom. 
10|98|Yunus: Jonah|If only there had been a community (of all those that were destroyed of old)  that believed and profited by its belief as did the folk of Jonah! When they believed  We drew off from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world and gave them  comfort for a while. 
10|99|Yunus: Jonah|And if thy Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed  together. Wouldst thou (Muhammad) compel men until they are believers ? 
10|100|Yunus: Jonah|It is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of Allah. He hath set  uncleanness upon those who have no sense. 
10|101|Yunus: Jonah|Say: Behold what is in the heavens and the earth! But revelations and  warnings avail not folk who will not believe. 
10|102|Yunus: Jonah|What expect they save the like of the days of those who passed away before  them ? Say: Expect then! I am with you among the expectant. 
10|103|Yunus: Jonah|Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers, in like manner (as of  old). It is incumbent upon Us to save believers. 
10|104|Yunus: Jonah|Say (O Muhammad): O mankind! If ye are in doubt of my religion, then  (know that) I worship not those whom ye worship instead of Allah, but I worship  Allah Who causeth you to die, and I have been commanded to be of the believers. 
10|105|Yunus: Jonah|And, (O Muhammad) set thy purpose resolutely for religion, as a man by  nature upright, and be not of those who ascribe partners (to Allah). 
10|106|Yunus: Jonah|And cry not, beside Allah, unto that which cannot profit thee nor hurt thee,  for if thou didst so then wert thou of the wrong-doers. 
10|107|Yunus: Jonah|If Allah afflicteth thee with some hurt, there is none who can remove it save  Him; and if He desireth good for thee, there is none who can repel His bounty. He  striketh with it whom He will of his bondmen. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
10|108|Yunus: Jonah|Say: O mankind! Now hath the Truth from your Lord come unto you. So  whosoever is guided, is guided only for (the good of) his soul, and whosoever erreth  erreth only against it. And I am not a warder over you. 
10|109|Yunus: Jonah|And (O Muhammad) follow that which is inspired in thee, and forbear until  Allah give judgment. And He is the Best of Judges. 
11|1|Hud: Hud|Alif. Lam. Ra. (This is) a Scripture the revelations whereof are perfected and  then expounded. (It cometh) from One Wise, Informed, 
11|2|Hud: Hud|(Saying): Serve none but Allah. Lo! I am unto you from Him a warner and a  bringer of good tidings. 
11|3|Hud: Hud|And (bidding you): Ask pardon of your Lord and turn to Him repentant. He  will cause you to enjoy a fair estate until a time appointed. He giveth His bounty unto  every bountiful one. But if ye turn away, lo! (then) I fear for you the retribution of an  awful Day. 
11|4|Hud: Hud|Unto Allah is your return, and He is Able to do all things. 
11|5|Hud: Hud|Lo! now they fold up their breasts that they may hide (their thoughts) from  Him. At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing, Allah  knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He is Aware  of what is in the breasts (of men). 
11|6|Hud: Hud|And there is not a beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on  Allah. He knoweth its habitation and its repository. All is in a clear Record. 
11|7|Hud: Hud|And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His  Throne was upon the water - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct.  Yet if thou (O Muhammad) sayest: Lo! ye will be raised again after death! those who  disbelieve will surely say: This is naught but mere magic. 
11|8|Hud: Hud|And if We delay for them the doom until a reckoned time, they will surely  say: What withholdeth it ? Verily on the day when it cometh unto them, it cannot be  averted from them, and that which they derided will surround them. 
11|9|Hud: Hud|And if we cause man to taste some mercy from Us and afterward withdraw it  from him, lo! he is despairing, thankless. 
11|10|Hud: Hud|And if We cause him to taste grace after some misfortune that had befallen  him, he saith: The ills have gone from me. Lo! he is exultant, boastful; 
11|11|Hud: Hud|Save those who persevere and do good works. Theirs will be forgiveness and  a great reward. 
11|12|Hud: Hud|A likely thing, that thou wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been  revealed unto thee, and that thy breast should be straitened for it, because they say:  Why hath not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with him ? Thou  art but a warner, and Allah is in charge of all things. 
11|13|Hud: Hud|Or they say: He hath invented it. Say: Then bring ten surahs, the like thereof,  invented, and call on everyone ye can beside Allah, if ye are truthful! 
11|14|Hud: Hud|And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it is revealed only in the  knowledge of Allah; and that there is no God save Him. Will ye then be (of) those  who surrender ? 
11|15|Hud: Hud|Whoso desireth the life of the world and its pomp, We shall repay them their  deeds herein, and therein they will not be wronged. 
11|16|Hud: Hud|Those are they for whom is naught in the Hereafter save the Fire. (All) that  they contrive here is vain and (all) that they are wont to do is fruitless. 
11|17|Hud: Hud|Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his  Lord, and a witness from Him reciteth it, and before it was the Book of Moses, an  example and a mercy ? Such believe therein, and whoso disbelieveth therein of the  clans, the Fire is his appointed place. So be not thou in doubt concerning it. Lo! it is  the Truth from thy Lord; but most of mankind believe not. 
11|18|Hud: Hud|Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah ?  Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: These are they  who lied concerning their Lord. Now the curse of Allah is upon wrong-doers, 
11|19|Hud: Hud|Who debar (men) from the way of Allah and would have it crooked, and who  are disbelievers in the Hereafter. 
11|20|Hud: Hud|Such will not escape in the earth, nor have they any protecting friends beside  Allah. For them the torment will be double. They could not bear to hear, and they  used not to see. 
11|21|Hud: Hud|Such are they who have lost their souls, and that which they used to invent  hath failed them. 
11|22|Hud: Hud|Assuredly in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers. 
11|23|Hud: Hud|Lo! those who believe and do good works and humble themselves before  their Lord: such are rightful owners of the Garden; they will abide therein. 
11|24|Hud: Hud|The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and  the hearer. Are they equal in similitude ? Will ye not then be admonished ? 
11|25|Hud: Hud|And We sent Noah unto his folk (and he said): Lo! I am a plain warner unto  you. 
11|26|Hud: Hud|That ye serve none, save Allah. Lo! I fear for you the retribution of a painful  Day. 
11|27|Hud: Hud|The chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: We see thee but a mortal  like us, and we see not that any follow thee save the most abject among us, without  reflection. We behold in you no merit above us - nay, we deem you liars. 
11|28|Hud: Hud|He said: O my people! Bethink you, if I rely on a clear proof from my Lord  and there hath come unto me a mercy from His presence, and it hath been made  obscure to you, can we compel you to accept it when ye are averse thereto ? 
11|29|Hud: Hud|And O my people! I ask of you no wealth therefor. My reward is the concern  only of Allah, and I am not going to thrust away those who believe - Lo! they have to  meet their Lord! - but I see you a folk that are ignorant. 
11|30|Hud: Hud|And, O my people! who would deliver me from Allah if I thrust them away ?  Will ye not then reflect ? 
11|31|Hud: Hud|I say not unto you: "I have the treasures of Allah" nor "I have knowledge of  the Unseen," nor say I: "Lo! I am an angel!" Nor say I unto those whom your eyes  scorn that Allah will not give them good - Allah knoweth best what is in their hearts -  Lo! then indeed I should be of the wrong-doers. 
11|32|Hud: Hud|They said: O Noah! Thou hast disputed with us and multiplied disputation  with us; now bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the  truthful. 
11|33|Hud: Hud|He said: Only Allah will bring it upon you if He will, and ye can by no  means escape. 
11|34|Hud: Hud|My counsel will not profit you if I were minded to advise you, if Allah's will  is to keep you astray. He is your Lord and unto Him ye will be brought back. 
11|35|Hud: Hud|Or say they (again): He hath invented it ? Say: If I have invented it, upon me  be my crimes, but I am innocent of (all) that ye commit. 
11|36|Hud: Hud|And it was inspired in Noah, (saying): No-one of thy folk will believe save  him who hath believed already. Be not distressed because of what they do. 
11|37|Hud: Hud|Build the ship under Our eyes and by Our inspiration, and speak not unto Me  on behalf of those who do wrong. Lo! they will be drowned. 
11|38|Hud: Hud|And he was building the ship, and every time that chieftains of his people  passed him, they made mock of him. He said: Though ye make mock of Us, yet We  mock at you even as ye mock; 
11|39|Hud: Hud|And ye shall know to whom a punishment that will confound him cometh,  and upon whom a lasting doom will fall. 
11|40|Hud: Hud|(Thus it was) till, when Our commandment came to pass and the oven  gushed forth water, We said: Load therein two of every kind, a pair (the male and  female), and thy household, save him against whom the word hath gone forth already,  and those who believe. And but a few were they who believed with him. 
11|41|Hud: Hud|And he said: Embark therein! In the name of Allah be its course and its  mooring. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful. 
11|42|Hud: Hud|And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains, and Noah cried unto his  son - and he was standing aloof - O my son! Come ride with us, and be not with the  disbelievers. 
11|43|Hud: Hud|He said: I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the  water. (Noah) said: This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of  Allah save him on whom He hath had mercy. And the wave came in between them,  so he was among the drowned. 
11|44|Hud: Hud|And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy water and, O sky! be cleared of  clouds! And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled.  And it (the ship) came to rest upon (the mount) Al-Judi and it was said: A far removal  for wrongdoing folk! 
11|45|Hud: Hud|And Noah cried unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Lo! my son is of my  household! Surely Thy promise is the truth and Thou are the Most Just of Judges. 
11|46|Hud: Hud|He said: O Noah! Lo! he is not of thy household; lo! he is of evil conduct, so  ask not of Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge. I admonish thee lest thou be  among the ignorant. 
11|47|Hud: Hud|He said: My Lord! Lo! in Thee do I seek refuge (from the sin) that I should  ask of Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless Thou forgive me and have  mercy on me I shall be among the lost. 
11|48|Hud: Hud|It was said (unto him): O Noah! Go thou down (from the mountain) with  peace from Us and blessings upon thee and some nations (that will spring) from those  with thee. (There will be other) nations unto whom We shall give enjoyment a long  while and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them. 
11|49|Hud: Hud|This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad).  Thou thyself knewest it not, nor did thy folk (know it) before this. Then have  patience. Lo! the sequel is for those who ward off (evil). 
11|50|Hud: Hud|And unto (the tribe of) A'ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said: O my  people! Serve Allah! Ye have no other God save Him. Lo! ye do but invent. 
11|51|Hud: Hud|O my people! I ask of you no reward for it. Lo! my reward is the concern  only of Him Who made me. Have ye then no sense ? 
11|52|Hud: Hud|And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn unto Him  repentant; He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you and will add unto you  strength to your strength. Turn not away, guilty! 
11|53|Hud: Hud|They said: O Hud! Thou hast brought us no clear proof and we are not going  to forsake our gods on thy (mere) saying, and we are not believers in thee. 
11|54|Hud: Hud|We say naught save that one of our gods hath possessed thee in an evil way.  He said: I call Allah to witness, and do ye (too) bear witness, that I am innocent of  (all) that ye ascribe as partners (to Allah) 
11|55|Hud: Hud|Beside Him. So (try to) circumvent me, all of you, give me no respite. 
11|56|Hud: Hud|Lo! I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Not an animal but  He doth grasp it by the forelock! Lo! my Lord is on a straight path. 
11|57|Hud: Hud|And if ye turn away, still I have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was  sent unto you, and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot  injure Him at all. Lo! my Lord is Guardian over all things. 
11|58|Hud: Hud|And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Hud and those who  believed with him by a mercy from Us; We saved them from a harsh doom. 
11|59|Hud: Hud|And such were A'ad. They denied the revelations of their Lord and flouted  His messengers and followed the command of every froward potentate. 
11|60|Hud: Hud|And a curse was made to follow them in the world and on the Day of  Resurrection. Lo! A'ad disbelieved in their Lord. A far removal for A'ad, the folk of  Hud! 
11|61|Hud: Hud|And unto (the tribe of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my  people! Serve Allah, Ye have no other God save Him. He brought you forth from the  earth and hath made you husband it. So ask forgiveness of Him and turn unto Him  repentant. Lo! my Lord is Nigh, Responsive. 
11|62|Hud: Hud|They said: O Salih! Thou hast been among us hitherto as that wherein our  hope was placed. Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped ? Lo!  we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us. 
11|63|Hud: Hud|He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on clear proof from my  Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from Him, who will save me from Allah if  I disobey Him ? Ye would add to me naught save perdition. 
11|64|Hud: Hud|O my people! This is the camel of Allah, a token unto you, so suffer her to  feed in Allah's earth, and touch her not with harm lest a near torment seize you. 
11|65|Hud: Hud|But they hamstrung her, and then he said: Enjoy life in your dwelling-place  three days! This is a threat that will not be belied. 
11|66|Hud: Hud|So, when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who  believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the ignominy of that day. Lo, thy Lord!  He is the Strong, the Mighty. 
11|67|Hud: Hud|And the (awful) Cry overtook those who did wrong, so that morning found  them prostrate in their dwellings, 
11|68|Hud: Hud|As though they had not dwelt there. Lo! Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. A  far removal for Thamud! 
11|69|Hud: Hud|And Our messengers cam unto Abraham with good news. They said: Peace!  He answered: Peace! and delayed not to bring a roasted calf. 
11|70|Hud: Hud|And when he saw their hands reached not to it, he mistrusted them and  conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! Lo! we are sent unto the folk of Lot. 
11|71|Hud: Hud|And his wife, standing by laughed when We gave her good tidings (of the  birth) of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob. 
11|72|Hud: Hud|She said: Oh woe is me! Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman, and  this my husband is an old man ? Lo! this is a strange thing! 
11|73|Hud: Hud|They said: Wonderest thou at the commandment of Allah ? The mercy of  Allah and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house! Lo! He is Owner of  Praise, Owner of Glory! 
11|74|Hud: Hud|And when the awe departed from Abraham, and the glad news reached him,  he pleaded with Us on behalf of the folk of Lot. 
11|75|Hud: Hud|Lo! Abraham was mild, imploring, penitent. 
11|76|Hud: Hud|(It was said) O Abraham! Forsake this! Lo! thy Lord's commandment hath  gone forth, and lo! there cometh unto them a doom which cannot be repelled. 
11|77|Hud: Hud|And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was distressed and knew not  how to protect them. He said: This is a distressful day. 
11|78|Hud: Hud|And his people came unto him, running towards him - and before then they  used to commit abominations - He said: O my people! Here are my daughters! They  are purer for you. Beware of Allah, and degrade me not in (the person of) my guests.  Is there not among you any upright man ? 
11|79|Hud: Hud|They said: Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters, and  well thou knowest what we want. 
11|80|Hud: Hud|He said: Would that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support  (among you)! 
11|81|Hud: Hud|(The messengers) said: O Lot! Lo! we are messengers of thy Lord; they shall  not reach thee. So travel with thy people in a part of the night, and let not one of you  turn round - (all) save thy wife. Lo! that which smiteth them will smite her (also). Lo!  their tryst is (for) the morning. Is not the morning nigh ? 
11|82|Hud: Hud|So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew (that township) and  rained upon it stones of clay, one after another, 
11|83|Hud: Hud|Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord (for the destruction of the  wicked). And they are never far from the wrong-doers. 
11|84|Hud: Hud|And unto Midian (We sent) their brother Shu'eyb.  He said: O my people!  Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him! And give not short measure and short  weight. Lo! I see you well-to-do, and lo! I fear for you the doom of a besetting Day. 
11|85|Hud: Hud|O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not  people in respect of their goods. And do not evil in the earth, causing corruption. 
11|86|Hud: Hud|That which Allah leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers; and I  am not a keeper over you. 
11|87|Hud: Hud|They said: O Shu'eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should  forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship, or that we (should leave off) doing  what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right  behaviour. 
11|88|Hud: Hud|He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on a clear proof from  my Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him (how can I concede  aught to you) ? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do. I  desire naught save reform so far as I am able. My welfare is only in Allah. In Him I  trust and unto Him I turn (repentant). 
11|89|Hud: Hud|And, O my people! Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there  befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud, and the folk of  Salih; and the folk of Lot are not far off from you. 
11|90|Hud: Hud|Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him (repentant). Lo! my Lord is  Merciful, Loving. 
11|91|Hud: Hud|They said: O Shu'eyb! We understand not much of that thou tellest, and lo!  we do behold thee weak among us. But for thy family, we should have stoned thee,  for thou art not strong against us. 
11|92|Hud: Hud|He said: O my people! Is my family more to be honoured by you than Allah  ? and ye put Him behind you, neglected! Lo! my Lord surroundeth what ye do. 
11|93|Hud: Hud|And, O my people! Act according to your power, lo! I (too) am acting. Ye  will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him, and who it is that  lieth. And watch! Lo! I am a watcher with you. 
11|94|Hud: Hud|And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu'eyb and those  who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the (Awful) Cry seized those who  did injustice, and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings, 
11|95|Hud: Hud|As though they had not dwelt there. A far removal for Midian, even as  Thamud had been removed afar! 
11|96|Hud: Hud|And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant 
11|97|Hud: Hud|Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they did follow the command of Pharaoh,  and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide. 
11|98|Hud: Hud|He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them  to the Fire for watering-place. Ah, hapless is the watering-place (whither they are)  led. 
11|99|Hud: Hud|A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection.  Hapless is the gift (that will be) given (them). 
11|100|Hud: Hud|That is (something) of the tidings of the townships (which were destroyed of  old). We relate it unto thee (Muhammad). Some of them are standing and some  (already) reaped. 
11|101|Hud: Hud|We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on  whom they call beside Allah availed them naught when came thy Lord's command;  they added to them naught save ruin. 
11|102|Hud: Hud|Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while  they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong. 
11|103|Hud: Hud|Lo! herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the  Hereafter. That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered, and that is a day that  will be witnessed. 
11|104|Hud: Hud|And We defer it only to a term already reckoned. 
11|105|Hud: Hud|On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission;  some among them will be wretched, (others) glad. 
11|106|Hud: Hud|As for those who will be wretched (on that day) they will be in the Fire;  sighing and wailing will be their portion therein, 
11|107|Hud: Hud|Abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which  thy Lord willeth. Lo! thy Lord is Doer of what He will. 
11|108|Hud: Hud|And as for those who will be glad (that day) they will be in the Garden,  abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord  willeth: a gift unfailing. 
11|109|Hud: Hud|So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these (folk) worship. They  worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime. Lo! we shall pay them their  whole due unabated. 
11|110|Hud: Hud|And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife thereupon;  and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, the case  would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave doubt concerning it. 
11|111|Hud: Hud|And lo! unto each thy Lord will verily repay his works in full. Lo! He is  Informed of what they do. 
11|112|Hud: Hud|So tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded, and those who turn  (unto Allah) with thee, and transgress not. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do. 
11|113|Hud: Hud|And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you, and ye  have no protecting friends against Allah, and afterward ye would not be helped. 
11|114|Hud: Hud|Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the  night. Lo! good deeds annul ill-deeds. This is reminder for the mindful. 
11|115|Hud: Hud|And have patience, (O Muhammad), for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the  good. 
11|116|Hud: Hud|If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a  remnant (of good sense) to warn (their people) from corruption in the earth, as did a  few of those whom We saved from them! The wrong-doers followed that by which  they were made sapless, and were guilty. 
11|117|Hud: Hud|In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk  were doing right. 
11|118|Hud: Hud|And if thy Lord had willed, He verily would have made mankind one nation,  yet they cease not differing, 
11|119|Hud: Hud|Save him on whom thy Lord hath mercy; and for that He did create them.  And the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled: Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and  mankind together. 
11|120|Hud: Hud|And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order  that thereby We may make firm thy heart. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth  and an exhortation and a reminder for believers. 
11|121|Hud: Hud|And say unto those who believe not: Act according to your power. Lo! We  (too) are acting. 
11|122|Hud: Hud|And wait! Lo! We (too) are waiting. 
11|123|Hud: Hud|And Allah's is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth, and unto Him the  whole matter will be returned. So worship Him and put thy trust in Him. Lo! thy Lord  is not unaware of what ye (mortals) do. 
12|1|Yusuf: Joseph|Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verse of the Scripture that maketh plain. 
12|2|Yusuf: Joseph|Lo! We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic, that ye may understand. 
12|3|Yusuf: Joseph|We narrate unto thee (Muhammad) the best of narratives in that We have  inspired in thee this Qur'an, though aforetime thou wast of the heedless. 
12|4|Yusuf: Joseph|When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream eleven  planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me. 
12|5|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: O my dear son! Tell not thy brethren of thy vision, lest they plot a  plot against thee. Lo! Satan is for man an open foe. 
12|6|Yusuf: Joseph|Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of  events, and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He  perfected it upon thy forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower, Wise. 
12|7|Yusuf: Joseph|Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty) for the  inquiring. 
12|8|Yusuf: Joseph|When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than  we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration. 
12|9|Yusuf: Joseph|(One said): Kill Joseph or cast him to some (other) land, so that your father's  favour may be all for you, and (that) ye may afterward be righteous folk. 
12|10|Yusuf: Joseph|One among them said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing, fling him  into the depth of the pit; some caravan will find him. 
12|11|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we  are good friends to him ? 
12|12|Yusuf: Joseph|Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we  shall take good care of him. 
12|13|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I  fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him. 
12|14|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band,  then surely we should have already perished. 
12|15|Yusuf: Joseph|Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place  him in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of  theirs when they know (thee) not. 
12|16|Yusuf: Joseph|And they came weeping to their father in the evening. 
12|17|Yusuf: Joseph|Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by  our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when  we speak the truth. 
12|18|Yusuf: Joseph|And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds  have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is  Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe. 
12|19|Yusuf: Joseph|And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his  pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a  treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did. 
12|20|Yusuf: Joseph|And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they  attached no value to him. 
12|21|Yusuf: Joseph|And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him  honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus  we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of  events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not. 
12|22|Yusuf: Joseph|And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge.  Thus We reward the good. 
12|23|Yusuf: Joseph|And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the  doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in Allah! Lo! he is my lord, who hath  treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper. 
12|24|Yusuf: Joseph|She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that  he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil  and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves. 
12|25|Yusuf: Joseph|And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from  behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his  reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom ? 
12|26|Yusuf: Joseph|(Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her  own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of  the liars. 
12|27|Yusuf: Joseph|And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the  truthful. 
12|28|Yusuf: Joseph|So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo! this is of the guile of  you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great. 
12|29|Yusuf: Joseph|O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for  thy sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty. 
12|30|Yusuf: Joseph|And women in the city said: The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill- deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain  aberration. 
12|31|Yusuf: Joseph|And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them  a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and  said (to Joseph): Come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him and  cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is no a human being. This is not  other than some gracious angel. 
12|32|Yusuf: Joseph|She said: This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil  act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned,  and verily shall be of those brought low. 
12|33|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me,  and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of  the foolish. 
12|34|Yusuf: Joseph|So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is  Hearer, Knower. 
12|35|Yusuf: Joseph|And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of  his innocence) to imprison him for a time. 
12|36|Yusuf: Joseph|And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: I dreamed  that I was pressing wine. The other said: I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head  bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see  thee of those good (at interpretation). 
12|37|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I  shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord  hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and  are disbelievers in the Hereafter. 
12|38|Yusuf: Joseph|And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and  Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the bounty  of Allah unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not  thanks. 
12|39|Yusuf: Joseph|O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or Allah the One, Almighty ? 
12|40|Yusuf: Joseph|Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye  and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with  Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the  right religion, but most men know not. 
12|41|Yusuf: Joseph|O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his  lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from  his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire. 
12|42|Yusuf: Joseph|And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: Mention  me in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his  lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years. 
12|43|Yusuf: Joseph|And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean  were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound  for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams. 
12|44|Yusuf: Joseph|They answered: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the  interpretation of dreams. 
12|45|Yusuf: Joseph|And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said:  I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth. 
12|46|Yusuf: Joseph|(And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed): Joseph! O thou  truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the  seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so  that they may know. 
12|47|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it in  the ear, all save a little which ye eat. 
12|48|Yusuf: Joseph|Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have  prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored. 
12|49|Yusuf: Joseph|Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops  and when they will press (wine and oil). 
12|50|Yusuf: Joseph|And the king said: Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto  him, he (Joseph) said: Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the  women who cut their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile. 
12|51|Yusuf: Joseph|He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye  asked an evil act of Joseph ? They answered: Allah Blameless! We know no evil of  him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he  is surely of the truthful. 
12|52|Yusuf: Joseph|(Then Joseph said: I asked for) this, that he (my lord) may know that I  betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the  betrayers. 
12|53|Yusuf: Joseph|I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the (human) soul enjoineth unto evil, save that  whereon my Lord hath mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful. 
12|54|Yusuf: Joseph|And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person.  And when he had talked with him he said: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence  established and trusted. 
12|55|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled  custodian. 
12|56|Yusuf: Joseph|Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where he  pleased. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the  good. 
12|57|Yusuf: Joseph|And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward off  (evil). 
12|58|Yusuf: Joseph|And Joseph's brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he  knew them but they knew him not. 
12|59|Yusuf: Joseph|And when he provided them with their provision he said: Bring unto me a  brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the  best of hosts ? 
12|60|Yusuf: Joseph|And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with  me, nor shall ye draw near. 
12|61|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: We will try to win him from his father: that we will surely do. 
12|62|Yusuf: Joseph|He said unto his young men: Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so  that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again. 
12|63|Yusuf: Joseph|So when they went back to their father they said: O our father! The measure  is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely we  will guard him well. 
12|64|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you  aforetime ? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who  show mercy. 
12|65|Yusuf: Joseph|And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their  merchandise had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we  ask ? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and  guard our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load). This (that  we bring now) is a light measure. 
12|66|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the  name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when  they gave him their undertaking he said: Allah is the Warden over what we say. 
12|67|Yusuf: Joseph|And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I  can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him  do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust. 
12|68|Yusuf: Joseph|And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it  would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob's soul  which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught  him; but most of mankind know not. 
12|69|Yusuf: Joseph|And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying:  Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did. 
12|70|Yusuf: Joseph|And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in  his brother's saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely  thieves! 
12|71|Yusuf: Joseph|They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost ? 
12|72|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: We have lost the king's cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a  camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it. 
12|73|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and  are no thieves. 
12|74|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars ? 
12|75|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the  penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers. 
12|76|Yusuf: Joseph|Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brother's bag,  then he produced it from his brother's bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could  not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed. We raise  by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one  more knowing. 
12|77|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it  secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): Ye are in  worse case, and Allah knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege. 
12|78|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of  us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness. 
12|79|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our  property; then truly we should be wrong-doers. 
12|80|Yusuf: Joseph|So, When they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The  eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in  Allah's name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime ? Therefore I shall not  go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me. He is the  Best of Judges. 
12|81|Yusuf: Joseph|Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We  testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen. 
12|82|Yusuf: Joseph|Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled  hither. Lo! we speak the truth. 
12|83|Yusuf: Joseph|(And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said:  Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely  patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the  Knower, the Wise. 
12|84|Yusuf: Joseph|And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his  eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing. 
12|85|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy  health is ruined or thou art of those who perish! 
12|86|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from  Allah that which ye know not. 
12|87|Yusuf: Joseph|Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair  not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving  folk. 
12|88|Yusuf: Joseph|And when they came (again) before him (Joseph) they said: O ruler!  Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so fill  for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the charitable, 
12|89|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance  ? 
12|90|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph ? He said: I am Joseph and this is  my brother. Allah hath shown us favour. Lo! he who wardeth off (evil) and endureth  (findeth favour); for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly. 
12|91|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were  indeed sinful. 
12|92|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most  Merciful of those who show mercy. 
12|93|Yusuf: Joseph|Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father's face, he will become  (again) a seer; and come to me with all your folk. 
12|94|Yusuf: Joseph|When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the  breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard. 
12|95|Yusuf: Joseph|(Those around him) said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration. 
12|96|Yusuf: Joseph|Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he  became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that  which ye know not ? 
12|97|Yusuf: Joseph|They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, for lo! we were  sinful. 
12|98|Yusuf: Joseph|He said: I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving,  the Merciful. 
12|99|Yusuf: Joseph|And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and  said: Come into Egypt safe, if Allah will! 
12|100|Yusuf: Joseph|And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him  prostrate, and he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My  Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the  prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me  and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the  Wise. 
12|101|Yusuf: Joseph|O my Lord! Thou hast given me (something) of sovereignty and hast taught  me (something) of the interpretation of events - Creator of the heavens and the earth!  Thou art my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die  muslim  (unto Thee), and join me to the righteous. 
12|102|Yusuf: Joseph|This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad).  Thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming. 
12|103|Yusuf: Joseph|And though thou try much, most men will not believe. 
12|104|Yusuf: Joseph|Thou askest them no fee for it. It is naught else than a reminder unto the  peoples. 
12|105|Yusuf: Joseph|How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by  with face averted! 
12|106|Yusuf: Joseph|And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners  (unto Him). 
12|107|Yusuf: Joseph|Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah's  punishment, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware ? 
12|108|Yusuf: Joseph|Say: This is my Way: I call on Allah with sure knowledge. I and whosoever  followeth me - Glory be to Allah! - and I am not of the idolaters. 
12|109|Yusuf: Joseph|We sent not before thee (any messengers) save men whom We inspired from  among the folk of the townships - Have they not travelled in the land and seen the  nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? And verily the abode of  the Hereafter, for those who ward off (evil), is best. Have ye then no sense ? - 
12|110|Yusuf: Joseph|Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then  came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And Our wrath cannot be  warded from the guilty. 
12|111|Yusuf: Joseph|In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no  invented story but a confirmation of the existing (Scripture) and a detailed  explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe. 
13|1|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is  revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. 
13|2|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted  the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth unto  an appointed term; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye  may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. 
13|3|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and  flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female).  He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who take  thought. 
13|4|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and  date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made  some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who  have sense. 
13|5|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are  we then forsooth (to be raised) in a new creation ? Such are they who disbelieve in  their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the Fire, they  will abide therein. 
13|6|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary  punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon for  mankind despite their wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment. 
13|7|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him  from his Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide. 
13|8|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs  absorb and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. 
13|9|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High  Exalted. 
13|10|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad, he  who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime. 
13|11|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by  Allah's command. Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they (first)  change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there is  none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. 
13|12|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the  heavy clouds. 
13|13|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He  launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute  (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath. 
13|14|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah  respond to them not at all, save as (is the response to) one who stretcheth forth his  hands toward water (asking) that it may come unto his mouth, and it will never reach  it. The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far) astray. 
13|15|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth,  willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours. 
13|16|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Say (O Muhammad): Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth ? Say: Allah.  Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for protectors, which, even for themselves,  have neither benefit nor hurt ? Say: Is the blind man equal to the seer, or is darkness  equal to light ? Or assign they unto Allah partners who created the like of His creation  so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them ? Say:  Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Almighty. 
13|17|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their  measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they  smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it - thus  Allah coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it  passeth away as scum upon the banks, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it  remaineth in the earth. Thus Allah coineth the similitudes. 
13|18|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|For those who answered Allah's call is bliss; and for those who answered not  His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof, they would  proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their habitation will be  hell, a dire abode. 
13|19|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth  like him who is blind ? But only men of understanding heed; 
13|20|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Such as keep the pact of Allah, and break not the covenant; 
13|21|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Such as unite that which Allah hath commandeth should be joined, and fear  their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning; 
13|22|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Such as persevere in seeking their Lord's Countenance and are regular in  prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and  overcome evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home, 
13|23|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their  fathers and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from every  gate, 
13|24|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|(Saying): Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will  be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. 
13|25|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that  which Allah hath commanded should be joined, and make mischief in the earth: theirs  is the curse and theirs the ill abode. 
13|26|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He  will); and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world is but  brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter. 
13|27|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from  his Lord! Say: Lo! Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth unto Himself all  who turn (unto Him), 
13|28|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah.  Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest! 
13|29|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss (their) journey's  end. 
13|30|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Thus We send thee (O Muhammad) unto a nation, before whom other  nations have passed away, that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have  inspired in thee, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord;  there is no God save Him. In Him do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse. 
13|31|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or the  earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak, (this Qur'an would have done so). Nay,  but Allah's is the whole command. Do not those who believe know that, had Allah  willed, He could have guided all mankind ? As for those who disbelieve, disaster  ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home  until the threat of Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. 
13|32|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And verily messengers (of Allah) were mocked before thee, but long I bore  with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and how (awful) was My  punishment! 
13|33|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware of  nothing) ? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name them. Is it that ye would  inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth ? Or is it but a way of  speaking ? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve  and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is  no guide. 
13|34|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|For them is torment in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the  Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah. 
13|35|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty  (to Allah): Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its shade; this is the  reward of those who keep their duty, while the reward of disbelievers is the Fire. 
13|36|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed  unto thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only  that I serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry, and unto Him is  my return. 
13|37|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Thus have We revealed it, a decisive utterance in Arabic; and if thou  shouldst follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge, then  truly wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender. 
13|38|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|And verily We sent messengers (to mankind) before thee, and We appointed  for them wives and offspring, and it was not (given) to any messenger that he should  bring a portent save by Allah's leave. For everything there is a time prescribed. 
13|39|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth (what He will), and with Him is  the source of ordinance. 
13|40|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them,  or make thee die (before its happening), thine is but conveyance (of the message).  Ours the reckoning. 
13|41|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts ?  (When) Allah doometh there is none that can postpone His doom, and He is swift at  reckoning. 
13|42|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|Those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is Allah's. He knoweth  that which each soul earneth. The disbelievers will come to know for whom will be  the sequel of the (heavenly) Home. 
13|43|ar-Ra`d: The Thunder|They who disbelieve say: Thou art no messenger (of Allah). Say: Allah, and  whosoever hath knowledge of the Scripture, is sufficient witness between me and  you. 
14|1|Ibrahim: Abraham|Alif. Lam. Ra. (This is) a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee  (Muhammad) that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light,  by the permission of their Lord, unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise, 
14|2|Ibrahim: Abraham|Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is  in the earth. and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom; 
14|3|Ibrahim: Abraham|Those who love the life of the world more than the Hereafter, and debar  (men) from the way of Allah and would have it crooked: such are far astray. 
14|4|Ibrahim: Abraham|And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk, that he  might make (the message) clear for them. Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray,  and guideth whom He will. He is the Mighty, the Wise. 
14|5|Ibrahim: Abraham|We verily sent Moses with Our revelations, saying: Bring thy people forth  from darkness unto light. And remind them of the days of Allah. Lo! therein are  revelations for each steadfast, thankful (heart). 
14|6|Ibrahim: Abraham|And (remind them) how Moses said unto his people: Remember Allah's  favour unto you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's folk who were afflicting you  with dreadful torment, and were slaying your sons and sparing your women; that was  a tremendous trial from your Lord. 
14|7|Ibrahim: Abraham|And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give thanks, I will give you more; but  if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment is dire. 
14|8|Ibrahim: Abraham|And Moses said: Though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless, lo!  Allah verily is Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
14|9|Ibrahim: Abraham|Hath not the history of those before you reached you: the folk of Noah, and  (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and those after them ? None save Allah knoweth  them. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs, but they thrust their hands  into their mouths, and said: Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent,  and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us. 
14|10|Ibrahim: Abraham|Their messengers said: Can there be doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of  the heavens and the earth ? He calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and  reprieve you unto an appointed term. They said: Ye are but mortals like us, who  would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring some  clear warrant. 
14|11|Ibrahim: Abraham|Their messengers said unto them: We are but mortals like you, but Allah  giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you a warrant  unless by the permission of Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust! 
14|12|Ibrahim: Abraham|How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways ?  We surely will endure the hurt ye do us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust. 
14|13|Ibrahim: Abraham|And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers: Verily we will drive  you out from our land, unless ye return to our religion. Then their Lord inspired them,  (saying): Verily we shall destroy the wrong-doers, 
14|14|Ibrahim: Abraham|And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land after them. This is for him  who feareth My Majesty and feareth My threats. 
14|15|Ibrahim: Abraham|And they sought help (from their Lord) and every froward potentate was  bought to naught; 
14|16|Ibrahim: Abraham|Hell is before him, and he is made to drink a festering water, 
14|17|Ibrahim: Abraham|Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow, and death cometh unto him from  every side while yet he cannot die, and before him is a harsh doom. 
14|18|Ibrahim: Abraham|A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their works are as ashes  which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no control of aught that  they have earned. That is the extreme failure. 
14|19|Ibrahim: Abraham|Hast thou not seen that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with  truth ? If He will, He can remove you and bring (in) some new creation; 
14|20|Ibrahim: Abraham|And that is no great matter for Allah. 
14|21|Ibrahim: Abraham|They all come forth unto their Lord. Then those who were despised say unto  those who were scornful: We were unto you a following, can ye then avert from us  aught of Allah's doom ? They say: Had Allah guided us, we should have guided you.  Whether we rage or patiently endure is (now) all one for us; we have no place of  refuge. 
14|22|Ibrahim: Abraham|And Satan saith, when the matter hath been decided: Lo! Allah promised you  a promise of truth; and I promised you, then failed you. And I had no power over you  save that I called unto you and ye obeyed me. So blame not, but blame yourselves. I  cannot help you, nor can ye help me, Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before  ascribed to me. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom. 
14|23|Ibrahim: Abraham|And those who believed and did good works are made to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, therein abiding by permission of their Lord, their  greeting therein: Peace! 
14|24|Ibrahim: Abraham|Seest thou not how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodly saying, as a goodly  tree, its root set firm, its branches reaching into heaven, 
14|25|Ibrahim: Abraham|Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord ? Allah coineth the  similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect. 
14|26|Ibrahim: Abraham|And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, uprooted from upon the  earth, possessing no stability. 
14|27|Ibrahim: Abraham|Allah confirmeth those who believe by a firm saying in the life of the world  and in the Hereafter, and Allah sendeth wrong-doers astray. And Allah doeth what He  will. 
14|28|Ibrahim: Abraham|Hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange for  thanklessness and led their people down to the Abode of Loss, 
14|29|Ibrahim: Abraham|(Even to) hell ? They are exposed thereto. A hapless end! 
14|30|Ibrahim: Abraham|And they set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead (men) from His way.  Say: Enjoy life (while ye may) for lo! your journey's end will be the Fire. 
14|31|Ibrahim: Abraham|Tell My bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which  We have given them, secretly and publicly, before a day cometh wherein there will be  neither traffick nor befriending. 
14|32|Ibrahim: Abraham|Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and causeth water to  descend from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you, and maketh the ships  to be of service unto you, that they may run upon the sea at His command, and hath  made of service unto you the rivers; 
14|33|Ibrahim: Abraham|And maketh the sun and the moon, constant in their courses, to be of service  unto you, and hath made of service unto you the night and the day. 
14|34|Ibrahim: Abraham|And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him, and if ye would count the bounty of  Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! man is verily a wrong-doer, an ingrate. 
14|35|Ibrahim: Abraham|And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make safe this territory, and preserve  me and my sons from serving idols. 
14|36|Ibrahim: Abraham|My Lord! Lo! they have led many of mankind astray. But whoso followeth  me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeyeth me - Still Thou art Forgiving, Merciful. 
14|37|Ibrahim: Abraham|Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley  near unto Thy holy House, our Lord! that they may establish proper worship; so  incline some hearts of men that they may yearn toward them, and provide Thou them  with fruits in order that they may be thankful. 
14|38|Ibrahim: Abraham|Our Lord! Lo! Thou knowest that which we hide and that which we  proclaim. Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah. 
14|39|Ibrahim: Abraham|Praise be to Allah Who hath given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac! Lo!  my Lord is indeed the Hearer of Prayer. 
14|40|Ibrahim: Abraham|My Lord! Make me to establish proper worship, and some of my posterity  (also); our Lord! and accept my prayer. 
14|41|Ibrahim: Abraham|Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents and believers on the day when the  account is cast. 
14|42|Ibrahim: Abraham|Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do. He but giveth them a  respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror), 
14|43|Ibrahim: Abraham|As they come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze returning  not to them, and their hearts as air. 
14|44|Ibrahim: Abraham|And warn mankind of a day when the doom will come upon them, and those  who did wrong will say: Our Lord! Reprieve us for a little while. We will obey Thy  call and will follow the messengers. (It will be answered): Did ye not swear before  that there would be no end for you ? 
14|45|Ibrahim: Abraham|And (have ye not) dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves  (of old) and (hath it not) become plain to you how We dealt with them and made  examples for you ? 
14|46|Ibrahim: Abraham|Verily they have plotted their plot, and their plot is with Allah, though their  plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved. 
14|47|Ibrahim: Abraham|So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers. Lo!  Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong). 
14|48|Ibrahim: Abraham|On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth, and the  heavens (also will be changed) and they will come forth unto Allah, the One, the  Almighty, 
14|49|Ibrahim: Abraham|Thou wilt see the guilty on that day linked together in chains, 
14|50|Ibrahim: Abraham|Their raiment of pitch, and the Fire covering their faces, 
14|51|Ibrahim: Abraham|That Allah may repay each soul what it hath earned. Lo! Allah is swift at  reckoning. 
14|52|Ibrahim: Abraham|This is a clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned  thereby, and that they may know that He is only One God, and that men of  understanding may take heed. 
15|1|al-Hijr: The Rock|Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading. 
15|2|al-Hijr: The Rock|It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims. 
15|3|al-Hijr: The Rock|Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will  come to know! 
15|4|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it. 
15|5|al-Hijr: The Rock|No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. 
15|6|al-Hijr: The Rock|And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art  indeed a madman! 
15|7|al-Hijr: The Rock|Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful ? 
15|8|al-Hijr: The Rock|We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the  disbelievers) would not be tolerated. 
15|9|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. 
15|10|al-Hijr: The Rock|We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of  old. 
15|11|al-Hijr: The Rock|And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him. 
15|12|al-Hijr: The Rock|Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty: 
15|13|al-Hijr: The Rock|They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone  before. 
15|14|al-Hijr: The Rock|And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting  through it, 
15|15|al-Hijr: The Rock|They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched. 
15|16|al-Hijr: The Rock|And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have  beautified it for beholders. 
15|17|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We have guarded it from every outcast devil, 
15|18|al-Hijr: The Rock|Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue. 
15|19|al-Hijr: The Rock|And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused  each seemly thing to grow therein. 
15|20|al-Hijr: The Rock|And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye  provide not. 
15|21|al-Hijr: The Rock|And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not  down save in appointed measure. 
15|22|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky,  and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof. 
15|23|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the  Inheritor. 
15|24|al-Hijr: The Rock|And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards. 
15|25|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware. 
15|26|al-Hijr: The Rock|Verily We created man of potter's clay of black mud altered, 
15|27|al-Hijr: The Rock|And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire. 
15|28|al-Hijr: The Rock|And (remember) when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a  mortal out of potter's clay of black mud altered, 
15|29|al-Hijr: The Rock|So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye  fall down, prostrating yourselves unto him. 
15|30|al-Hijr: The Rock|So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together 
15|31|al-Hijr: The Rock|Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate. 
15|32|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate ? 
15|33|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast  created out of potter's clay of black mud altered! 
15|34|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast. 
15|35|al-Hijr: The Rock|And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment. 
15|36|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. 
15|37|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved 
15|38|al-Hijr: The Rock|Till the Day of appointed time. 
15|39|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the  path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one, 
15|40|al-Hijr: The Rock|Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves. 
15|41|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me: 
15|42|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the  froward as follow thee, 
15|43|al-Hijr: The Rock|And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place. 
15|44|al-Hijr: The Rock|It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion. 
15|45|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among gardens and watersprings. 
15|46|al-Hijr: The Rock|(And it is said unto them): Enter them in peace, secure. 
15|47|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face  to face, (they rest) on couches raised. 
15|48|al-Hijr: The Rock|Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence. 
15|49|al-Hijr: The Rock|Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving,  the Merciful, 
15|50|al-Hijr: The Rock|And that My doom is the dolorous doom. 
15|51|al-Hijr: The Rock|And tell them of Abraham's guests, 
15|52|al-Hijr: The Rock|(How) when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are  afraid of you. 
15|53|al-Hijr: The Rock|They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing  wisdom. 
15|54|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a son) when old age hath overtaken me  ? Of what then can ye bring good tidings ? 
15|55|al-Hijr: The Rock|They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the  despairing. 
15|56|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are  astray ? 
15|57|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ? 
15|58|al-Hijr: The Rock|They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk, 
15|59|al-Hijr: The Rock|(All) save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one, 
15|60|al-Hijr: The Rock|Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who  stay behind. 
15|61|al-Hijr: The Rock|And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot, 
15|62|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to me). 
15|63|al-Hijr: The Rock|They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep  disputing, 
15|64|al-Hijr: The Rock|And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers. 
15|65|al-Hijr: The Rock|So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou their  backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded. 
15|66|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them (who did wrong)  was to be cut at early morn. 
15|67|al-Hijr: The Rock|And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals). 
15|68|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not! 
15|69|al-Hijr: The Rock|And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not! 
15|70|al-Hijr: The Rock|They said; Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ? 
15|71|al-Hijr: The Rock|He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing (so). 
15|72|al-Hijr: The Rock|By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching  death. 
15|73|al-Hijr: The Rock|Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the sunrise. 
15|74|al-Hijr: The Rock|And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated  clay. 
15|75|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs. 
15|76|al-Hijr: The Rock|And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced. 
15|77|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers. 
15|78|al-Hijr: The Rock|And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers. 
15|79|al-Hijr: The Rock|So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to  see. 
15|80|al-Hijr: The Rock|And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our) messengers. 
15|81|al-Hijr: The Rock|And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them. 
15|82|al-Hijr: The Rock|And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt)  secure. 
15|83|al-Hijr: The Rock|But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the morning hour, 
15|84|al-Hijr: The Rock|And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not. 
15|85|al-Hijr: The Rock|We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save  with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a  gracious forgiveness. 
15|86|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator. 
15|87|al-Hijr: The Rock|We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an. 
15|88|al-Hijr: The Rock|Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among  them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing (in  tenderness) for the believers. 
15|89|al-Hijr: The Rock|And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner, 
15|90|al-Hijr: The Rock|Such as We send down for those who make division, 
15|91|al-Hijr: The Rock|Those who break the Qur'an into parts. 
15|92|al-Hijr: The Rock|Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one, 
15|93|al-Hijr: The Rock|Of what they used to do. 
15|94|al-Hijr: The Rock|So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the  idolaters. 
15|95|al-Hijr: The Rock|Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers, 
15|96|al-Hijr: The Rock|Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know. 
15|97|al-Hijr: The Rock|Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say, 
15|98|al-Hijr: The Rock|But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration (unto  Him). 
15|99|al-Hijr: The Rock|And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee. 
16|1|an-Nahl: The Bee|The commandment of Allah will come to pass, so seek not ye to hasten it.  Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate (with Him). 
16|2|an-Nahl: The Bee|He sendeth down the angels with the Spirit of His command unto whom He  will of His bondmen, (saying): Warn mankind that there is no God save Me, so keep  your duty unto Me. 
16|3|an-Nahl: The Bee|He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. High be He Exalted  above all that they associate (with Him). 
16|4|an-Nahl: The Bee|He hath created man from a drop of fluid, yet behold! he is an open  opponent. 
16|5|an-Nahl: The Bee|And the cattle hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing and uses, and  whereof ye eat; 
16|6|an-Nahl: The Bee|And wherein is beauty for you, when ye bring them home, and when ye take  them out to pasture. 
16|7|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they bear your loads for you unto a land ye could not reach save with  great trouble to yourselves. Lo! your Lord is Full of Pity, Merciful. 
16|8|an-Nahl: The Bee|And horses and mules and asses (hath He created) that ye may ride them, and  for ornament. And He createth that which ye know not. 
16|9|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah's is the direction of the way, and some (roads) go not straight.  And had He willed He would have led you all aright. 
16|10|an-Nahl: The Bee|He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, whence ye have drink, and  whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture. 
16|11|an-Nahl: The Bee|Therewith He causeth crops to grow for you, and the olive and the date-palm  and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect. 
16|12|an-Nahl: The Bee|And He hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to  be of service unto you, and the stars are made subservient by His command. Lo!  herein indeed are portents for people who have sense. 
16|13|an-Nahl: The Bee|And whatsoever He hath created for you in the earth of divers hues, lo!  therein is indeed a portent for people who take heed. 
16|14|an-Nahl: The Bee|And He it is Who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh  meat from thence, and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear. And thou  seest the ships ploughing it that ye (mankind) may seek of His bounty and that haply  ye may give thanks. 
16|15|an-Nahl: The Bee|And He hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you, and  streams and roads that ye may find a way. 
16|16|an-Nahl: The Bee|And landmarks (too), and by the star they find a way. 
16|17|an-Nahl: The Bee|Is He then Who createth as him who createth not ? Will ye not then  remember ? 
16|18|an-Nahl: The Bee|And if ye would count the favour of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! Allah is  indeed Forgiving, Merciful. 
16|19|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim. 
16|20|an-Nahl: The Bee|Those unto whom they cry beside Allah created naught, but are themselves  created. 
16|21|an-Nahl: The Bee|(They are) dead, not living. And they know not when they will be raised. 
16|22|an-Nahl: The Bee|Your God is One God. But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter their  hearts refuse to know, for they are proud. 
16|23|an-Nahl: The Bee|Assuredly Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they  proclaim. Lo! He loveth not the proud. 
16|24|an-Nahl: The Bee|And when it is said unto them: What hath your Lord revealed ? they say:  (Mere) fables of the men of old, 
16|25|an-Nahl: The Bee|That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection,  with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Ah!  evil is that which they bear! 
16|26|an-Nahl: The Bee|Those before them plotted, so Allah struck at the foundations of their  building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom  came on them whence they knew not; 
16|27|an-Nahl: The Bee|Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: Where  are My partners, for whose sake ye opposed (My guidance) ? Those who have been  given knowledge will say: Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers, 
16|28|an-Nahl: The Bee|Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves. Then will  they make full submission (saying): We used not to do any wrong. Nay! Surely Allah  is Knower of what ye used to do. 
16|29|an-Nahl: The Bee|So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever. Woeful indeed will be the  lodging of the arrogant. 
16|30|an-Nahl: The Bee|And it is said unto those who ward off (evil): What hath your Lord revealed ?  They say: Good. For those who do good in this world there is a good (reward) and the  home of the Hereafter will be better. Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who  ward off (evil) - 
16|31|an-Nahl: The Bee|Gardens of Eden which they enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein  they have what they will. Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off (evil), 
16|32|an-Nahl: The Bee|Those whom the angels cause to die (when they are) good. They say: Peace  be unto you! Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do. 
16|33|an-Nahl: The Bee|Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord's  command should come to pass ? Even so did those before them. Allah wronged them  not, but they did wrong themselves, 
16|34|an-Nahl: The Bee|So that the evils of what they did smote them, and that which they used to  mock surrounded them. 
16|35|an-Nahl: The Bee|And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside  Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him.  Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain  conveyance (of the message) ? 
16|36|an-Nahl: The Bee|And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger, (proclaiming): Serve  Allah and shun false gods. Then some of them (there were) whom Allah guided, and  some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold. Do but travel in the land  and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers! 
16|37|an-Nahl: The Bee|Even if thou (O Muhammad) desirest their right guidance, still Allah  assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth. Such have no helpers. 
16|38|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they swear by Allah their most binding oaths (that) Allah will not raise  up him who dieth. Nay, but it is a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of  mankind know not, 
16|39|an-Nahl: The Bee|That He may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and that those who  disbelieved may know that they were liars. 
16|40|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Our word unto a thing, when We intend it, is only that We say unto it:  Be! and it is. 
16|41|an-Nahl: The Bee|And those who became fugitives for the cause of Allah after they had been  oppressed, We verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world, and surely the  reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew; 
16|42|an-Nahl: The Bee|Such as are steadfast and put their trust in Allah. 
16|43|an-Nahl: The Bee|And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men whom We  inspired - Ask the followers of the Remembrance if ye know not! - 
16|44|an-Nahl: The Bee|With clear proofs and writings; and We have revealed unto thee the  Remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for  them, and that haply they may reflect. 
16|45|an-Nahl: The Bee|Are they who plan ill-deeds then secure that Allah will not cause the earth to  swallow them, or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not ? 
16|46|an-Nahl: The Bee|Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no  escape for them ? 
16|47|an-Nahl: The Bee|Or that He will not seize them with a gradual wasting ? Lo! thy Lord is  indeed Full of Pity, Merciful. 
16|48|an-Nahl: The Bee|Have they not observed all things that Allah hath created, how their shadows  incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly ? 
16|49|an-Nahl: The Bee|And unto Allah maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures, and the angels (also) and they are not  proud. 
16|50|an-Nahl: The Bee|They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are bidden. 
16|51|an-Nahl: The Bee|Allah hath said: Choose not two gods. There is only One God. So of Me, Me  only, be in awe. 
16|52|an-Nahl: The Bee|Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and religion  is His for ever. Will ye then fear any other than Allah ? 
16|53|an-Nahl: The Bee|And whatever of comfort ye enjoy, it is from Allah. Then, when misfortune  reacheth you, unto Him ye cry for help. 
16|54|an-Nahl: The Bee|And afterward, when He hath rid you of the misfortune, behold! a set of you  attribute partners to their Lord, 
16|55|an-Nahl: The Bee|So as to deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life (while ye  may), for ye will come to know. 
16|56|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they  know not. By Allah! but ye will indeed be asked concerning (all) that ye used to  invent. 
16|57|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they assign unto Allah daughters - Be He Glorified! - and unto  themselves what they desire; 
16|58|an-Nahl: The Bee|When if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of a female, his face  remaineth darkened, and he is wroth inwardly. 
16|59|an-Nahl: The Bee|He hideth himself from the folk because of the evil of that whereof he hath  had tidings, (asking himself): Shall he keep it in contempt, or bury it beneath the dust.  Verily evil is their judgment. 
16|60|an-Nahl: The Bee|For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil similitude, and Allah's is  the Sublime Similitude. He is the Mighty, the Wise. 
16|61|an-Nahl: The Bee|If Allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong-doing, he would not  leave hereon a living creature, but He reprieveth them to an appointed term, and when  their term cometh they cannot put (it) off an hour nor (yet) advance (it). 
16|62|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they assign unto Allah that which they (themselves) dislike, and their  tongues expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs. Assuredly theirs will be  the Fire, and they will be abandoned. 
16|63|an-Nahl: The Bee|By Allah, We verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee, but the  devil made their deeds fairseeming unto them. So he is their patron this day, and  theirs  will be a painful doom. 
16|64|an-Nahl: The Bee|And We have revealed the Scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain  unto them that wherein they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who  believe. 
16|65|an-Nahl: The Bee|Allah sendeth down water from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after  her death. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a folk who hear. 
16|66|an-Nahl: The Bee|And lo! in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that  which is in their bellies, from betwixt the refuse and the blood, pure milk palatable to  the drinkers. 
16|67|an-Nahl: The Bee|And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink  and (also) good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who have  sense. 
16|68|an-Nahl: The Bee|And thy Lord inspired the bee, saying: Choose thou habitations in the hills  and in the trees and in that which they thatch; 
16|69|an-Nahl: The Bee|Then eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of thy Lord, made smooth (for  thee). There cometh forth from their bellies a drink divers of hues, wherein is healing  for mankind. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect. 
16|70|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah createth you, then causeth you to die, and among you is he who is  brought back to the most abject stage of life, so that he knoweth nothing after (having  had) knowledge. Lo! Allah is Knower, Powerful. 
16|71|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision. Now those  who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those (slaves)  whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect  thereof. Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny ? 
16|72|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind, and hath given you, from  your wives, sons and grandsons, and hath made provision of good things for you. Is it  then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of Allah that they disbelieve ? 
16|73|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they worship beside Allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever  for them from the heavens or the earth, nor have they (whom they worship) any  power. 
16|74|an-Nahl: The Bee|So coin not similitudes for Allah. Lo! Allah knoweth; ye know not. 
16|75|an-Nahl: The Bee|Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath  control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair  provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal ?  Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not. 
16|76|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control  of nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go, he  bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight  path (of conduct) ? 
16|77|an-Nahl: The Bee|And unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the  matter of the Hour (of Doom) is but as a twinkling of the eye, or it is nearer still. Lo!  Allah is Able to do all things. 
16|78|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing  nothing, and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks. 
16|79|an-Nahl: The Bee|Have they not seen the birds obedient in mid-air ? None holdeth them save  Allah. Lo! herein, verily, are portents for a people who believe. 
16|80|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah hath given you in your houses an abode, and hath given you  (also), of the hides of cattle, houses which ye find light (to carry) on the day of  migration and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool and their fur and their  hair, caparison and comfort for a while. 
16|81|an-Nahl: The Bee|And Allah hath given you, of that which He hath created, shelter from the  sun; and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains, and hath given you coats  to ward off the heat from you, and coats (of armour) to save you from your own  foolhardiness. Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you, in order that ye may  surrender (unto Him). 
16|82|an-Nahl: The Bee|Then, if they turn away, thy duty (O Muhammad) is but plain conveyance (of  the message). 
16|83|an-Nahl: The Bee|They know the favour of Allah and then deny it. Most of them are ingrates. 
16|84|an-Nahl: The Bee|And (bethink you of) the day when we raise up of every nation a witness,  then there is no leave for disbelievers, nor are they allowed to make amends. 
16|85|an-Nahl: The Bee|And when those who did wrong behold the doom, it will not be made light  for them, nor will they be reprieved. 
16|86|an-Nahl: The Bee|And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of  theirs, they will say: Our Lord! these are our partners unto whom we used to cry  instead of Thee. But they will fling to them the saying: Lo! ye verily are liars! 
16|87|an-Nahl: The Bee|And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day, and all that they used to  invent hath failed them. 
16|88|an-Nahl: The Bee|For those who disbelieve and debar (men) from the way of Allah, We add  doom to doom because they wrought corruption, 
16|89|an-Nahl: The Bee|And (bethink you of) the day when We raise in every nation a witness  against them of their own folk, and We bring thee (Muhammad) as a witness against  these. And We reveal the Scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things, and a  guidance and a mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah). 
16|90|an-Nahl: The Bee|Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and  forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorteth you in order that  ye may take heed. 
16|91|an-Nahl: The Bee|Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted, and break not your  oaths after the asseveration of them, and after ye have made Allah surety over you.  Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do. 
16|92|an-Nahl: The Bee|And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread, after she hath made it  strong, to thin filaments, making your oaths a deceit between you because of a nation  being more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only trieth you thereby, and He  verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye differed. 
16|93|an-Nahl: The Bee|Had Allah willed He could have made you (all) one nation, but He sendeth  whom He will astray and guideth whom He will, and ye will indeed be asked of what  ye used to do. 
16|94|an-Nahl: The Bee|Make not your oaths a deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after being  firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred (men) from the way  of Allah, and yours should be an awful doom. 
16|95|an-Nahl: The Bee|And purchase not a small gain at the price of Allah's covenant. Lo! that  which Allah hath is better for you, if ye did but know. 
16|96|an-Nahl: The Bee|That which ye have wasteth away, and that which Allah hath remaineth. And  verily We shall pay those who are steadfast a recompense in proportion to the best of  what they used to do. 
16|97|an-Nahl: The Bee|Whosoever doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, him verily  we shall quicken with good life, and We shall pay them a recompense in proportion to  the best of what they used to do. 
16|98|an-Nahl: The Bee|And when thou recitest the Qur'an, seek refuge in Allah from Satan the  outcast. 
16|99|an-Nahl: The Bee|Lo! he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their Lord. 
16|100|an-Nahl: The Bee|His power is only over those who make a friend of him, and those who  ascribe partners unto Him (Allah). 
16|101|an-Nahl: The Bee|And when We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation, - and Allah  knoweth best what He revealeth - they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of them  know not. 
16|102|an-Nahl: The Bee|Say: The holy Spirit hath delivered it from thy Lord with truth, that it may  confirm (the faith of) those who believe, and as guidance and good tidings for those  who have surrendered (to Allah). 
16|103|an-Nahl: The Bee|And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him. The speech of  him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish, and this is clear Arabic speech. 
16|104|an-Nahl: The Bee|Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, Allah guideth them not  and theirs will be a painful doom. 
16|105|an-Nahl: The Bee|Only they invent falsehood who believe not Allah's revelations, and (only)  they are the liars. 
16|106|an-Nahl: The Bee|Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief - save him who is forced thereto  and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief:  On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom. 
16|107|an-Nahl: The Bee|That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the  Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
16|108|an-Nahl: The Bee|Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah hath sealed. And such  are the heedless. 
16|109|an-Nahl: The Bee|Assuredly in the Hereafter they are the losers. 
16|110|an-Nahl: The Bee|Then lo! thy Lord - for those who became fugitives after they had been  persecuted, and then fought and were steadfast - lo! thy Lord afterward is (for them)  indeed Forgiving, Merciful. 
16|111|an-Nahl: The Bee|On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul  will be repaid what it did, and they will not be wronged. 
16|112|an-Nahl: The Bee|Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content, its  provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in Allah's  favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they  used to do. 
16|113|an-Nahl: The Bee|And verily there had come unto them a messenger from among them, but  they had denied him, and so the torment seized them while they were wrong-doers. 
16|114|an-Nahl: The Bee|So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah hath provided for you, and  thank the bounty of your Lord if it is Him ye serve. 
16|115|an-Nahl: The Bee|He hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that  which hath been immolated in the name of any other than Allah; but he who is driven  thereto, neither craving nor transgressing, lo! then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
16|116|an-Nahl: The Bee|And speak not, concerning that which your own tongues qualify (as clean or  unclean), the falsehood: "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," so that ye invent a lie  against Allah. Lo! those who invent a lie against Allah will not succeed. 
16|117|an-Nahl: The Bee|A brief enjoyment (will be theirs); and theirs a painful doom. 
16|118|an-Nahl: The Bee|And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have  already related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong  themselves. 
16|119|an-Nahl: The Bee|Then lo! thy Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent  and amend - lo! (for them) thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful. 
16|120|an-Nahl: The Bee|Lo! Abraham was a nation obedient to Allah, by nature upright, and he was  not of the idolaters; 
16|121|an-Nahl: The Bee|Thankful for His bounties; He chose him and He guided him unto a straight  path. 
16|122|an-Nahl: The Bee|And We gave him good in the world, and in the Hereafter he is among the  righteous. 
16|123|an-Nahl: The Bee|And afterward We inspired thee (Muhammad, saying): Follow the religion of  Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters. 
16|124|an-Nahl: The Bee|The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it, and lo!  thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that  wherein they used to differ. 
16|125|an-Nahl: The Bee|Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation, and reason  with them in the better way. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from  His way, and He is Best Aware of those who go aright. 
16|126|an-Nahl: The Bee|If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted.  But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient. 
16|127|an-Nahl: The Bee|Endure thou patiently (O Muhammad). Thine endurance is only by (the help  of) Allah. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress because of that which they  devise. 
16|128|an-Nahl: The Bee|Lo! Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are  doers of good. 
17|1|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place  of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have  blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the  Seer. 
17|2|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the  children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me. 
17|3|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(They were) the seed of those whom We carried (in the ship) along with  Noah. Lo! he was a grateful slave. 
17|4|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will  work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. 
17|5|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves  of Ours of great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed. 
17|6|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with  wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. 
17|7|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(Saying): If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is  for them (in like manner). So, when the time for the second (of the judgments) came  (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and to enter the Temple  even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an  utter wasting. 
17|8|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat (the crime)  We shall repeat (the punishment), and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the  disbelievers. 
17|9|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Lo! this Qur'an guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings unto  the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward. 
17|10|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared  a painful doom. 
17|11|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty. 
17|12|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the  portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may  seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and  the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding. 
17|13|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And every man's augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall  bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open. 
17|14|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(And it will be said unto him): Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner  against thee this day. 
17|15|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Whosoever goeth right, it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth  right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can bear another's  load, We never punish until we have sent a messenger. 
17|16|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk  who live at ease, and afterward they commit abomination therein, and so the Word (of  doom) hath effect for it, and we annihilate it with complete annihilation. 
17|17|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! And Allah sufficeth  as Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves. 
17|18|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Whoso desireth that (life) which hasteneth away, We hasten for him therein  what We will for whom We please. And afterward We have appointed for him hell;  he will endure the heat thereof, condemned, rejected. 
17|19|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary,  being a believer; for such, their effort findeth favour (with their Lord). 
17|20|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Each do We supply, both these and those, from the bounty of thy Lord. And  the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up. 
17|21|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|See how We prefer one of them above another, and verily the Hereafter will  be greater in degrees and greater in preferment. 
17|22|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Set not up with Allah any other god (O man) lest thou sit down reproved,  forsaken. 
17|23|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and (that ye show)  kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, say not  "Fie" unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word. 
17|24|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy, and say: My  Lord! Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little. 
17|25|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds. If ye are righteous, then  lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn (unto Him). 
17|26|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Give the kinsman his due, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and squander not  (thy wealth) in wantonness. 
17|27|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Lo! the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils, and the devil was ever  an ingrate to his Lord. 
17|28|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|But if thou turn away from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord, for which  thou hopest, then speak unto them a reasonable word. 
17|29|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete  opening, lest thou sit down rebuked, denuded. 
17|30|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Lo! thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for  whom He will). Lo, He was ever Knower, Seer of His slaves. 
17|31|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Slay not your children, fearing a fall to poverty, We shall provide for them  and for you. Lo! the slaying of them is great sin. 
17|32|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way. 
17|33|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And slay not the life which Allah hath forbidden save with right. Whoso is  slain wrongfully, We have given power unto his heir, but let him not commit excess  in slaying. Lo! he will be helped. 
17|34|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he  come to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo! of the covenant it will be asked. 
17|35|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Fill the measure when ye measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is  meet, and better in the end. 
17|36|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(O man), follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge. Lo! the hearing  and the sight and the heart - of each of these it will be asked. 
17|37|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And walk not in the earth exultant. Lo! thou canst not rend the earth, nor  canst thou stretch to the height of the hills. 
17|38|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|The evil of all that is hateful in the sight of thy Lord. 
17|39|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|This is (part) of that wisdom wherewith thy Lord hath inspired thee (O  Muhammad). And set not up with Allah any other god, lest thou be cast into hell,  reproved, abandoned. 
17|40|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Hath your Lord then distinguished you (O men of Makka) by giving you  sons, and hath chosen for Himself females from among the angels ? Lo! verily ye  speak an awful word! 
17|41|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|We verily have displayed (Our warnings) in this Qur'an that they may take  heed, but it increaseth them in naught save aversion. 
17|42|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): If there were other gods along with  Him, as they say, then had they sought a way against the Lord of the Throne. 
17|43|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Glorified is He, and High Exalted above what they say! 
17|44|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise Him, and there  is not a thing but hymneth His praise; but ye understand not their praise. Lo! He is  ever Clement, Forgiving. 
17|45|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And when thou recitest the Qur'an we place between thee and those who  believe not in the Hereafter a hidden barrier; 
17|46|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it, and in  their ears a deafness; and when thou makest mention of thy Lord alone in the Qur'an,  they turn their backs in aversion. 
17|47|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|We are Best Aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to thee and  when they take secret counsel, when the evil-doers say: Ye follow but a man  bewitched. 
17|48|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|See what similitudes they coin for thee, and thus are all astray, and cannot  find a road! 
17|49|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And they say: When we are bones and fragments, shall we forsooth, be  raised up as a new creation ? 
17|50|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Be ye stones or iron 
17|51|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts! Then they will  say: Who shall bring us back (to life). Say: He Who created you at the first. Then will  they shake their heads at thee, and say: When will it be ? Say: It will perhaps be soon; 
17|52|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|A day when He will call you and ye will answer with His praise, and ye will  think that ye have tarried but a little while. 
17|53|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier. Lo! the devil soweth  discord among them. Lo! the devil is for man an open foe. 
17|54|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Your Lord is Best Aware of you. If He will, He will have mercy on you, or if  He will, He will punish you. We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) as a warden over  them. 
17|55|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And thy Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And  we preferred some of the prophets above others, and unto David We gave the Psalms. 
17|56|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Cry unto those (saints and angels) whom ye assume (to be gods) beside  Him, yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change. 
17|57|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their Lord, which of  them shall be the nearest; they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom. Lo! the  doom of thy Lord is to be shunned. 
17|58|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|There is not a township but We shall destroy it ere the Day of Resurrection,  or punish it with dire punishment. That is set forth in the Book (of Our decrees). 
17|59|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Naught hindereth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied  them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel - a clear portent save to warn. 
17|60|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And (it was a warning) when we told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth  mankind, and We appointed the sight which We showed thee as an ordeal for  mankind, and (likewise) the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an. We warn them, but it  increaseth them in naught save gross impiety. 
17|61|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And when We said unto the angels: Fall down prostrate before Adam and  they fell prostrate all save Iblis, he said: Shall I fall prostrate before that which Thou  hast created of clay ? 
17|62|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|He said: Seest Thou this (creature) whom Thou hast honoured above me, if  Thou give me grace until the Day of Resurrection I verily will seize his seed, save but  a few. 
17|63|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|He said: Go, and whosoever of them followeth thee - lo! hell will be your  payment, ample payment. 
17|64|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And excite any of them whom thou canst with thy voice, and urge thy horse  and foot against them, and be a partner in their wealth and children, and promise  them. Satan promiseth them only to deceive. 
17|65|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Lo! My (faithful) bondmen - over them thou hast no power, and thy Lord  sufficeth as (their) guardian. 
17|66|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(O mankind), your Lord is He Who driveth for you the ship upon the sea that  ye may seek of His bounty. Lo! He was ever Merciful toward you. 
17|67|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And when harm toucheth you upon the sea, all unto whom ye cry (for  succour) fail save Him (alone), but when He bringeth you safe to land, ye turn away,  for man was ever thankless. 
17|68|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Feel ye then secure that He will not cause a slope of the land to engulf you,  or send a sand-storm upon you, and then ye will find that ye have no protector ? 
17|69|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Or feel ye secure that He will not return you to that (plight) a second time,  and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness, and  then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger against Us ? 
17|70|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Verily we have honoured the Children of Adam. We carry them on the land  and the sea, and have made provision of good things for them, and have preferred  them above many of those whom We created with a marked preferment. 
17|71|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|On the day when We shall summon all men with their record, whoso is given  his book in his right hand - such will read their book and they will not be wronged a  shred. 
17|72|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Whoso is blind here will be blind in the Hereafter, and yet further from the  road. 
17|73|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And they indeed strove hard to beguile thee (Muhammad) away from that  wherewith We have inspired thee, that thou shouldst invent other than it against Us;  and then would they have accepted thee as a friend. 
17|74|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined  unto them a little. 
17|75|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Then had we made thee taste a double (punishment) of living and a double  (punishment) of dying, then hadst thou found no helper against Us. 
17|76|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land that they might drive  thee forth from thence, and then they would have stayed (there) but a little after thee. 
17|77|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(Such was Our) method in the case of those whom We sent before thee (to  mankind), and thou wilt not find for Our method aught of power to change. 
17|78|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night, and  (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn. Lo! (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn is ever  witnessed. 
17|79|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And some part of the night awake for it, a largess for thee. It may be that thy  Lord will raise thee to a praised estate. 
17|80|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And say: My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out  with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power. 
17|81|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And say: Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away. Lo! falsehood  is ever bound to vanish. 
17|82|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And We reveal of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for  believers though it increase the evil-doers in naught save ruin. 
17|83|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turneth away and is averse;  and when ill toucheth him he is in despair. 
17|84|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Each one doth according to his rule of conduct, and thy Lord is Best  Aware of him whose way is right. 
17|85|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|They are asking thee concerning the Spirit. Say: The Spirit is by command of  my Lord, and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little. 
17|86|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto  thee, then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof. 
17|87|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|(It is naught) save mercy from thy Lord. Lo! His kindness unto thee was ever  great. 
17|88|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Verily, though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the  like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers  one of another. 
17|89|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all kind of  similitudes, but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief. 
17|90|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And they say: We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush  forth from the earth for us; 
17|91|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush  forth therein abundantly; 
17|92|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal, as thou hast pretended,  or bring Allah and the angels as a warrant; 
17|93|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend up into heaven, and even then  we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that we can  read. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord be Glorified! Am I aught save a mortal  messenger ? 
17|94|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto  them save that they said: Hath Allah sent a mortal as (His) messenger ? 
17|95|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for  them from heaven an angel as messenger. 
17|96|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you. Lo! He is Knower,  Seer of His slaves. 
17|97|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And he whom Allah guideth, he is led aright; while, as for him whom He  sendeth astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him, and We shall  assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their  habitation will be hell; whenever it abateth, We increase the flame for them. 
17|98|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said: When  we are bones and fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up as a new creation ? 
17|99|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able  to create the like of them, and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no  doubt ? But the wrong-doers refuse aught save disbelief. 
17|100|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say (unto them): If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye  would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man was ever grudging. 
17|101|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens, clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty). Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, then Pharaoh  said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses. 
17|102|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|He said: In truth thou knowest that none sent down these (portents) save the  Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs, and lo! (for my part) I deem thee lost, O  Pharaoh. 
17|103|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And he wished to scare them from the land, but We drowned him and those  with him, all together. 
17|104|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And We said unto the Children of Israel after him: Dwell in the land; but  when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd  gathered out of various nations. 
17|105|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|With truth have We sent it down, and with truth hath it descended. And We  have sent thee as naught else save a bearer of good tidings and a warner. 
17|106|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And (it is) a Qur'an that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto  mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation. 
17|107|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say: Believe therein or believe not, lo! those who were given knowledge  before it, when it is read unto them, fall down prostrate on their faces, adoring, 
17|108|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Saying: Glory to our Lord! Verily the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled. 
17|109|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|They fall down on their faces, weeping, and it increaseth humility in them. 
17|110|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|Say (unto mankind): Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto  whichsoever ye cry (it is the same). His are the most beautiful names. And thou  (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a  way between. 
17|111|bani Isra'il: The Israelites|And say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath not taken unto Himself a son, and  Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty, nor hath He any protecting friend through  dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence. 
18|1|al-Kahf: The Cave|Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath  not placed therein any crookedness, 
18|2|al-Kahf: The Cave|(But hath made it) straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him,  and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair  reward, 
18|3|al-Kahf: The Cave|Wherein they will abide for ever; 
18|4|al-Kahf: The Cave|And to warn those who say: Allah hath chosen a son, 
18|5|al-Kahf: The Cave|(A thing) whereof they have no knowledge, nor (had) their fathers, Dreadful  is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie. 
18|6|al-Kahf: The Cave|Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou (Muhammad)  wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps. 
18|7|al-Kahf: The Cave|Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We  may try them: which of them is best in conduct. 
18|8|al-Kahf: The Cave|And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound. 
18|9|al-Kahf: The Cave|Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder  among Our portents ? 
18|10|al-Kahf: The Cave|When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us  mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight. 
18|11|al-Kahf: The Cave|Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years. 
18|12|al-Kahf: The Cave|And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two  parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried. 
18|13|al-Kahf: The Cave|We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who  believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. 
18|14|al-Kahf: The Cave|And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is  the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no God beside Him, for then  should we utter an enormity. 
18|15|al-Kahf: The Cave|These, our people, have chosen (other) gods beside Him though they bring  no clear warrant (vouchsafed) to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who  inventeth a lie concerning Allah ? 
18|16|al-Kahf: The Cave|And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah,  then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will  prepare for you a pillow in your plight. 
18|17|al-Kahf: The Cave|And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their  cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft  thereof. That was (one) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is  led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding  friend. 
18|18|al-Kahf: The Cave|And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and  We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his  paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly  turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them. 
18|19|al-Kahf: The Cave|And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another.  A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried ? They said: We have   tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye  have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him  see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous  and let no man know of you. 
18|20|al-Kahf: The Cave|For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you  back to their religion; then ye will never prosper. 
18|21|al-Kahf: The Cave|And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they  might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no  doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among  themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best  concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of  worship over them. 
18|22|al-Kahf: The Cave|(Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five,  their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the  eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth  them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending,  and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them. 
18|23|al-Kahf: The Cave|And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow, 
18|24|al-Kahf: The Cave|Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say:  It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this. 
18|25|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine. 
18|26|al-Kahf: The Cave|Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the  heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no  protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government. 
18|27|al-Kahf: The Cave|And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy  Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside  Him. 
18|28|al-Kahf: The Cave|Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and  evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the  pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless  of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been  abandoned. 
18|29|al-Kahf: The Cave|Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him  believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for  disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be  showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the  drink and ill the resting-place! 
18|30|al-Kahf: The Cave|Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the  reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost. 
18|31|al-Kahf: The Cave|As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath  them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest  silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the reward, and fair the  resting-place! 
18|32|al-Kahf: The Cave|Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned  two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put  between them tillage. 
18|33|al-Kahf: The Cave|Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We  caused a river to gush forth therein. 
18|34|al-Kahf: The Cave|And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I  am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men. 
18|35|al-Kahf: The Cave|And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I  think not that all this will ever perish. 
18|36|al-Kahf: The Cave|I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back  unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. 
18|37|al-Kahf: The Cave|His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in  Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man  ? 
18|38|al-Kahf: The Cave|But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner. 
18|39|al-Kahf: The Cave|If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah  willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me  as less than thee in wealth and children, 
18|40|al-Kahf: The Cave|Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send  on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside, 
18|41|al-Kahf: The Cave|Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst  not make search for it. 
18|42|al-Kahf: The Cave|And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands  for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to  say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord! 
18|43|al-Kahf: The Cave|And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save  himself. 
18|44|al-Kahf: The Cave|In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward,  and best for consequence. 
18|45|al-Kahf: The Cave|And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We  send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then  becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things. 
18|46|al-Kahf: The Cave|Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good  deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of  hope. 
18|47|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth  emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind. 
18|48|al-Kahf: The Cave|And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now  verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We  had set no tryst for you. 
18|49|al-Kahf: The Cave|And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is  therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a  great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and  thy Lord wrongeth no-one. 
18|50|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam,  and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his  Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead  of Me, when they are an enemy unto you ? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers. 
18|51|al-Kahf: The Cave|I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor  their own creation; nor choose I misleaders for (My) helpers. 
18|52|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (be mindful of) the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine  whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer,  and We shall set a gulf of doom between them. 
18|53|al-Kahf: The Cave|And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein,  and they find no way of escape thence. 
18|54|al-Kahf: The Cave|And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all manner of  similitudes, but man is more than anything contentious. 
18|55|al-Kahf: The Cave|And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh  unto them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord unless (it be that they wish) that  the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or (that) they should be  confronted with the Doom. 
18|56|al-Kahf: The Cave|We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners.  Those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby.  And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest. 
18|57|al-Kahf: The Cave|And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the  revelations of his Lord, yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands  send forward (to the Judgment) ? Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so  that they understand not, and in their ears a deafness. And though thou call them to  the guidance, in that case they can never be led aright. 
18|58|al-Kahf: The Cave|Thy Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. If He took them to task (now) for  what they earn, He would hasten on the doom for them; but theirs is an appointed  term from which they will find no escape. 
18|59|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (all) those townships! We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We  appointed a fixed time for their destruction. 
18|60|al-Kahf: The Cave|And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not give up until I reach the  point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages. 
18|61|al-Kahf: The Cave|And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish,  and it took its way into the waters, being free. 
18|62|al-Kahf: The Cave|And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant: Bring us our  breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey. 
18|63|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the  fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it - it took its way into the  waters by a marvel. 
18|64|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: This is that which we have been seeking. So they retraced their steps  again. 
18|65|al-Kahf: The Cave|Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from  Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence. 
18|66|al-Kahf: The Cave|Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me  right conduct of that which thou hast been taught ? 
18|67|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me. 
18|68|al-Kahf: The Cave|How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any  knowledge ? 
18|69|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught  gainsay thee. 
18|70|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself  make mention of it unto thee. 
18|71|al-Kahf: The Cave|So they twain set out till, when they were in the ship, he made a hole therein.  (Moses) said: Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof ? Thou verily  hast done a dreadful thing. 
18|72|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ? 
18|73|al-Kahf: The Cave|(Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me  for my fault. 
18|74|al-Kahf: The Cave|So they twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. (Moses)  said: What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man ? Verily thou hast  done a horrid thing. 
18|75|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ? 
18|76|al-Kahf: The Cave|(Moses) said: If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company  with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me. 
18|77|al-Kahf: The Cave|So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain  township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests. And  they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it.  (Moses) said: If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken payment for it. 
18|78|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee  the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience. 
18|79|al-Kahf: The Cave|As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I wished  to mar it, for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by force. 
18|80|al-Kahf: The Cave|And as for the lad, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should  oppress them by rebellion and disbelief. 
18|81|al-Kahf: The Cave|And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in  purity and nearer to mercy. 
18|82|al-Kahf: The Cave|And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was  beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father had been righteous, and thy  Lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their  treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it not upon my own command. Such is  the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear. 
18|83|al-Kahf: The Cave|They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn. Say: I shall recite unto you a  remembrance of him. 
18|84|al-Kahf: The Cave|Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road. 
18|85|al-Kahf: The Cave|And he followed a road 
18|86|al-Kahf: The Cave|Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a  muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Either  punish or show them kindness. 
18|87|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: As for him who doeth wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will  be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with awful punishment! 
18|88|al-Kahf: The Cave|But as for him who believeth and doeth right, good will be his reward, and  We shall speak unto him a mild command. 
18|89|al-Kahf: The Cave|Then he followed a road 
18|90|al-Kahf: The Cave|Till, when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a  people for whom We had appointed no shelter therefrom. 
18|91|al-Kahf: The Cave|So (it was). And We knew all concerning him. 
18|92|al-Kahf: The Cave|Then he followed a road 
18|93|al-Kahf: The Cave|Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither  side a folk that scarce could understand a saying. 
18|94|al-Kahf: The Cave|They said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land. So  may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them ? 
18|95|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me is better (than your  tribute). Do but help me with strength (of men), I will set between you and them a  bank. 
18|96|al-Kahf: The Cave|Give me pieces of iron - till, when he had levelled up (the gap) between the  cliffs, he said: Blow! - till, when he had made it a fire, he said: Bring me molten  copper to pour thereon. 
18|97|al-Kahf: The Cave|And (Gog and Magog) were not able to surmount, nor could they pierce (it). 
18|98|al-Kahf: The Cave|He said: This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord  cometh to pass, He will lay it low, for the promise of my Lord is true. 
18|99|al-Kahf: The Cave|And on that day we shall let some of them surge against others, and the  Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering. 
18|100|al-Kahf: The Cave|On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view, 
18|101|al-Kahf: The Cave|Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not  bear to hear. 
18|102|al-Kahf: The Cave|Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting  friends beside Me ? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. 
18|103|al-Kahf: The Cave|Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works ? 
18|104|al-Kahf: The Cave|Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon  that they do good work. 
18|105|al-Kahf: The Cave|Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the  meeting with Him. Therefor their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We  assign no weight to them. 
18|106|al-Kahf: The Cave|That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our  revelations and Our messengers. 
18|107|al-Kahf: The Cave|Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise  for welcome, 
18|108|al-Kahf: The Cave|Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence. 
18|109|al-Kahf: The Cave|Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea  would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We  brought the like thereof to help. 
18|110|al-Kahf: The Cave|Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is  only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do  righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord. 
19|1|Maryam: Mary|Kaf. Ha. Ya. A'in. Sad. 
19|2|Maryam: Mary|A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah. 
19|3|Maryam: Mary|When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret, 
19|4|Maryam: Mary|Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining  with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. 
19|5|Maryam: Mary|Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from  Thy presence a successor 
19|6|Maryam: Mary|Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make  him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). 
19|7|Maryam: Mary|(It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son  whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). 
19|8|Maryam: Mary|He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have  reached infirm old age ? 
19|9|Maryam: Mary|He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created  thee before, when thou wast naught. 
19|10|Maryam: Mary|He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that  thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. 
19|11|Maryam: Mary|Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to  them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night. 
19|12|Maryam: Mary|(And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave  him wisdom when a child, 
19|13|Maryam: Mary|And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout, 
19|14|Maryam: Mary|And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious. 
19|15|Maryam: Mary|Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall  be raised alive! 
19|16|Maryam: Mary|And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from  her people to a chamber looking East, 
19|17|Maryam: Mary|And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and  it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. 
19|18|Maryam: Mary|She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God- fearing. 
19|19|Maryam: Mary|He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a  faultless son. 
19|20|Maryam: Mary|She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither  have I been unchaste ? 
19|21|Maryam: Mary|He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be)  that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a  thing ordained. 
19|22|Maryam: Mary|And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. 
19|23|Maryam: Mary|And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She  said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! 
19|24|Maryam: Mary|Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath  placed a rivulet beneath thee, 
19|25|Maryam: Mary|And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates  to fall upon thee. 
19|26|Maryam: Mary|So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I  have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. 
19|27|Maryam: Mary|Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary!  Thou hast come with an amazing thing. 
19|28|Maryam: Mary|O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a  harlot. 
19|29|Maryam: Mary|Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the  cradle, a young boy ? 
19|30|Maryam: Mary|He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and  hath appointed me a Prophet, 
19|31|Maryam: Mary|And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon  me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, 
19|32|Maryam: Mary|And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me  arrogant, unblest. 
19|33|Maryam: Mary|Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be  raised alive! 
19|34|Maryam: Mary|Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning  which they doubt. 
19|35|Maryam: Mary|It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son.  Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. 
19|36|Maryam: Mary|And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right  path. 
19|37|Maryam: Mary|The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting  of an awful Day. 
19|38|Maryam: Mary|See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to- day in error manifest. 
19|39|Maryam: Mary|And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now  they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. 
19|40|Maryam: Mary|Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they  are returned. 
19|41|Maryam: Mary|And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was  a saint, a prophet. 
19|42|Maryam: Mary|When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which  heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ? 
19|43|Maryam: Mary|O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came  not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. 
19|44|Maryam: Mary|O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent. 
19|45|Maryam: Mary|O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee  so that thou become a comrade of the devil. 
19|46|Maryam: Mary|He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham ? If thou cease not, I shall  surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! 
19|47|Maryam: Mary|He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo!  He was ever gracious unto me. 
19|48|Maryam: Mary|I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I  shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be  unblest. 
19|49|Maryam: Mary|So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were  worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a  prophet. 
19|50|Maryam: Mary|And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true  renown. 
19|51|Maryam: Mary|And make mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was  a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. 
19|52|Maryam: Mary|We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in  communion. 
19|53|Maryam: Mary|And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet  (likewise). 
19|54|Maryam: Mary|And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his  promise, and he was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. 
19|55|Maryam: Mary|He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in  the sight of his Lord. 
19|56|Maryam: Mary|And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; 
19|57|Maryam: Mary|And We raised him to high station. 
19|58|Maryam: Mary|These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of  the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the  seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose.  When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down,  adoring and weeping. 
19|59|Maryam: Mary|Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined  worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception. 
19|60|Maryam: Mary|Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the  Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught - 
19|61|Maryam: Mary|Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the  unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment - 
19|62|Maryam: Mary|They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for  morn and evening. 
19|63|Maryam: Mary|Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to  inherit. 
19|64|Maryam: Mary|We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him  belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those  two, and thy Lord was never forgetful - 
19|65|Maryam: Mary|Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor,  worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be  named along with Him ? 
19|66|Maryam: Mary|And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive ? 
19|67|Maryam: Mary|Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught ? 
19|68|Maryam: Mary|And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We  shall bring them, crouching, around hell. 
19|69|Maryam: Mary|Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most  stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent. 
19|70|Maryam: Mary|And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein. 
19|71|Maryam: Mary|There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy  Lord. 
19|72|Maryam: Mary|Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers  crouching there. 
19|73|Maryam: Mary|And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve  say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in  position, and more imposing as an army ? 
19|74|Maryam: Mary|How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more  imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming! 
19|75|Maryam: Mary|Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span  of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be  punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in  position and who is weaker as an army. 
19|76|Maryam: Mary|Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds  which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort. 
19|77|Maryam: Mary|Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly  I shall be given wealth and children ? 
19|78|Maryam: Mary|Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent ? 
19|79|Maryam: Mary|Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of  torment. 
19|80|Maryam: Mary|And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto  Us, alone (without his wealth and children). 
19|81|Maryam: Mary|And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for  them. 
19|82|Maryam: Mary|Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto  them. 
19|83|Maryam: Mary|Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound  them with confusion ? 
19|84|Maryam: Mary|So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto  them a sum (of days). 
19|85|Maryam: Mary|On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly  company. 
19|86|Maryam: Mary|And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd, 
19|87|Maryam: Mary|They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a  covenant with his Lord. 
19|88|Maryam: Mary|And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. 
19|89|Maryam: Mary|Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing 
19|90|Maryam: Mary|Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the  mountains fall in ruins, 
19|91|Maryam: Mary|That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son, 
19|92|Maryam: Mary|When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should  choose a son. 
19|93|Maryam: Mary|There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as  a slave. 
19|94|Maryam: Mary|Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering. 
19|95|Maryam: Mary|And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection,  alone. 
19|96|Maryam: Mary|Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for  them love. 
19|97|Maryam: Mary|And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that  thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn  therewith the froward folk. 
19|98|Maryam: Mary|And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou  (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ? 
20|1|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Ta. Ha. 
20|2|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an that thou shouldst  be distressed, 
20|3|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|But as a reminder unto him who feareth, 
20|4|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens, 
20|5|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne. 
20|6|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod. 
20|7|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret (thought) and  (that which is yet) more hidden. 
20|8|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Allah! There is no God save Him. His are the most beautiful names. 
20|9|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses ? 
20|10|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off.  Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire. 
20|11|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses! 
20|12|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy  valley of Tuwa. 
20|13|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired. 
20|14|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish  worship for My remembrance. 
20|15|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul  may be rewarded for that which it striveth (to achieve). 
20|16|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Therefor, let not him turn thee aside from (the thought of) it who believeth  not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish. 
20|17|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses ? 
20|18|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down  branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses. 
20|19|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Cast it down, O Moses! 
20|20|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding. 
20|21|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Grasp it and fear not. We shall return it to its former state. 
20|22|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without  hurt. (That will be) another token. 
20|23|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|That We may show thee (some) of Our greater portents, 
20|24|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds). 
20|25|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Moses) said: My Lord! relieve my mind 
20|26|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And ease my task for me; 
20|27|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And loose a knot from my tongue, 
20|28|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|That they may understand my saying. 
20|29|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Appoint for me a henchman from my folk, 
20|30|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Aaron, my brother. 
20|31|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Confirm my strength with him 
20|32|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And let him share my task, 
20|33|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|That we may glorify Thee much 
20|34|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And much remember Thee. 
20|35|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us. 
20|36|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Thou art granted thy request, O Moses. 
20|37|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And indeed, another time, already We have shown thee favour, 
20|38|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired, 
20|39|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Saying: Throw him into the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river  shall throw it on to the bank, and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall  take him. And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained  according to My will, 
20|40|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him ?  and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not  sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried  thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian. Then  camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses, 
20|41|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And I have attached thee to Myself. 
20|42|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Go, thou and thy brother, with My tokens, and be not faint in remembrance  of Me. 
20|43|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds). 
20|44|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear. 
20|45|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that  he may play the tyrant. 
20|46|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Fear not. Lo! I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing. 
20|47|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are two messengers of thy Lord. So let  the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring thee a token from  thy Lord. And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance. 
20|48|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth  and turneth away. 
20|49|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Pharaoh) said: Who then is the Lord of you twain, O Moses ? 
20|50|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature, then guided it  aright. 
20|51|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: What then is the state of the generations of old ? 
20|52|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord  neither erreth nor forgetteth, 
20|53|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you  therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth  divers kinds of vegetation, 
20|54|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Saying): Eat ye and feed your cattle. Lo! herein verily are portents for men  of thought. 
20|55|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring  you forth a second time. 
20|56|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused. 
20|57|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses ? 
20|58|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst  between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place  convenient (to us both). 
20|59|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Moses) said: Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people  assemble when the sun hath risen high. 
20|60|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength, then came (to the appointed  tryst). 
20|61|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Moses said unto them: Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He  extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably. 
20|62|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then they debated one with another what they must do, and they kept their  counsel secret. 
20|63|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your  country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions; 
20|64|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day  will be indeed successful. 
20|65|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: O Moses! Either throw first, or let us be the first to throw ? 
20|66|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo! their cords and their staves, by their  magic, appeared to him as though they ran. 
20|67|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And Moses conceived a fear in his mind. 
20|68|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher. 
20|69|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have  made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard shall not  be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may attain. 
20|70|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then the wizards were (all) flung down prostrate, crying: We believe in the  Lord of Aaron and Moses. 
20|71|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Pharaoh) said: Ye put faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he is your  chief who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet  alternately, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for  certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment. 
20|72|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto  us, and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end  for us only this life of the world. 
20|73|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic  unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting. 
20|74|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will  neither die nor live. 
20|75|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|But whoso cometh unto Him a believer, having done good works, for such  are the high stations; 
20|76|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for  ever. That is the reward of him who groweth. 
20|77|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night and  strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid  (of the sea). 
20|78|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that  which did cover them of the sea. 
20|79|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them. 
20|80|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and we made a  covenant with you on the holy mountain's side, and sent down on you the manna and  the quails, 
20|81|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and  transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My  wrath cometh, he is lost indeed. 
20|82|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and  doeth good, and afterward walketh aright. 
20|83|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And (it was said): What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses ? 
20|84|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that  Thou mightest be well pleased. 
20|85|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As-Samiri hath  misled them. 
20|86|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said: O my people!  Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise ? Did the time appointed then appear  too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you,  that ye broke tryst with me ? 
20|87|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden  with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them (in the fire), for thus As-Samiri  proposed. 
20|88|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing  sound. And they cried: This is your god and the god of Moses, but he hath forgotten. 
20|89|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for  them neither hurt nor use ? 
20|90|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being  seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my  order. 
20|91|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return  unto us. 
20|92|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He (Moses) said: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them  gone astray, 
20|93|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|That thou followedst me not ? Hast thou then disobeyed my order ? 
20|94|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest  thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and hast  not waited for my word. 
20|95|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Moses) said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri ? 
20|96|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the  footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me. 
20|97|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|(Moses) said: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch me not!  and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which  thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the  sea. 
20|98|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God. He embraceth all  things in His knowledge. 
20|99|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Thus relate We unto thee (Muhammad) some tidings of that which happened  of old, and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder. 
20|100|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of  Resurrection, 
20|101|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Abiding under it - an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection, 
20|102|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty  white-eyed (with terror), 
20|103|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Murmuring among themselves: Ye have tarried but ten (days). 
20|104|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say: Ye  have tarried but a day. 
20|105|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|They will ask thee of the mountains (on that day). Say: My Lord will break  them into scattered dust. 
20|106|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And leave it as an empty plain, 
20|107|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness. 
20|108|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are  hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur. 
20|109|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|On that day no intercession availeth save (that of) him unto whom the  Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth. 
20|110|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He knoweth (all) that is before them and (all) that is behind them, while they  cannot compass it in knowledge. 
20|111|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who  beareth (a burden of) wrongdoing is indeed a failure (on that day). 
20|112|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not  injustice nor begrudging (of his wage). 
20|113|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein  certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to  take heed. 
20|114|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not (O Muhammad) with  the Qur'an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord!  Increase me in knowledge. 
20|115|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We  found no constancy in him. 
20|116|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell  prostrate (all) save Iblis; he refused. 
20|117|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so  let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil. 
20|118|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked, 
20|119|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun's heat. 
20|120|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|But the devil whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree  of immortality and power that wasteth not away ? 
20|121|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them,  and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden.  And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray. 
20|122|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him. 
20|123|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He said: Go down hence, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But  when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance,  he will not go astray nor come to grief. 
20|124|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life,  and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection. 
20|125|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when  I was wont to see ? 
20|126|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|He will say: So (it must be). Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst  forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day. 
20|127|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of  his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting. 
20|128|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Is it not a guidance for them (to know) how many a generation We destroyed  before them, amid whose dwellings they walk ? Lo! therein verily are signs for men  of thought. 
20|129|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term  already fixed, the judgment would have been inevitable (in this world). 
20|130|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Therefor (O Muhammad), bear with what they say, and celebrate the praise  of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him  some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find  acceptance. 
20|131|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs  among them to enjoy, the flower of the life of the world, that We may try them  thereby. The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting. 
20|132|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And enjoin upon thy people worship, and be constant therein. We ask not of  thee a provision: We provided for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness. 
20|133|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And they say: If only he would bring us a miracle from his Lord! Hath there  not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures ? 
20|134|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|And if we had destroyed them with some punishment before it, they would  assuredly have said: Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so that  we might have followed Thy revelations before we were (thus) humbled and  disgraced! 
20|135|Ta Ha: Ta Ha|Say: Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye will come to know who are the  owners of the path of equity, and who is right. 
21|1|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in  heedlessness. 
21|2|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen  to it while they play, 
21|3|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is  this other than a mortal like you ? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it) ? 
21|4|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is  the Hearer, the Knower. 
21|5|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it;  nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were God's  messengers) were sent (with portents). 
21|6|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though  We sent them portents): would they then believe ? 
21|7|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We  inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not ? 
21|8|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. 
21|9|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom  We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. 
21|10|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have  ye then no sense ? 
21|11|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up  after them another folk! 
21|12|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it! 
21|13|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which  emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. 
21|14|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers. 
21|15|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct. 
21|16|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. 
21|17|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence  - if We ever did. 
21|18|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo!  it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him). 
21|19|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those  who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; 
21|20|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They glorify (Him) night and day; they flag not. 
21|21|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead ? 
21|22|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the  earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that  they ascribe (unto Him). 
21|23|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be  questioned. 
21|24|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Or have they chosen other gods beside Him ? say: Bring your proof (of their  godhead). This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of  them know not the Truth and so they are averse. 
21|25|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There  is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me. 
21|26|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He  Glorified! Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves; 
21|27|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command. 
21|28|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot  intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him. 
21|29|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We  should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers. 
21|30|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of  one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water ? Will they  not then believe ? 
21|31|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We  have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. 
21|32|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away  from its portents. 
21|33|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.  They float, each in an orbit. 
21|34|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can  they be immortal! 
21|35|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for  ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned. 
21|36|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for  mockery, (saying): Is this he who maketh mention of your gods ? And they would  deny all mention of the Beneficent. 
21|37|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to  hasten. 
21|38|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And they say: When will this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? 
21|39|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to  drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped! 
21|40|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and  they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved. 
21|41|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked  surrounded those who scoffed at them. 
21|42|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent ? Nay,  but they turn away from mention of their Lord! 
21|43|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Or have they gods who can shield them from Us ? They cannot help  themselves nor can they be defended from Us. 
21|44|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Nay, but We gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them.  See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts ? Can they then  be the victors ? 
21|45|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I warn you only by the Inspiration. But  the deaf hear not the call when they are warned. 
21|46|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And if a breath of thy Lord's punishment were to touch them, they assuredly  would say: Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers. 
21|47|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul is  wronged in aught. Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We bring it.  And We suffice for reckoners. 
21|48|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion (of right and wrong) and  a light and a Reminder for those who keep from evil, 
21|49|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Those who fear their Lord in secret and who dread the Hour (of doom). 
21|50|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|This is a blessed Reminder that we have revealed: Will ye then reject it ? 
21|51|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We verily gave Abraham of old his proper course, and We were Aware  of him, 
21|52|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|When he said unto his father and his folk: What are these images unto which  ye pay devotion ? 
21|53|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them. 
21|54|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He said: Verily ye and your fathers were in plain error. 
21|55|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: Bringest thou unto us the truth, or art thou some jester ? 
21|56|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He said: Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who  created them; and I am of those who testify unto that. 
21|57|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And, by Allah, I shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and  turned your backs. 
21|58|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then he reduced them to fragments, all save the chief of them, that haply  they might have recourse to it. 
21|59|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: Who hath done this to our gods ? Surely it must be some evil- doer. 
21|60|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: We heard a youth make mention of them, who is called Abraham. 
21|61|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: Then bring him (hither) before the people's eyes that they may  testify. 
21|62|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They said: Is it thou who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham ? 
21|63|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He said: But this, their chief hath done it. So question them, if they can  speak. 
21|64|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then gathered they apart and said: Lo! ye yourselves are the wrong-doers. 
21|65|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that  these speak not. 
21|66|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all,  nor harm you ? 
21|67|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense ? 
21|68|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing. 
21|69|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham, 
21|70|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers. 
21|71|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have  blessed for (all) peoples. 
21|72|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them  We made righteous. 
21|73|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in  them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of  alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone). 
21|74|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from  the community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd. 
21|75|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous. 
21|76|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his  household from the great affliction. 
21|77|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they  were folk of evil, therefor did We drown them all. 
21|78|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field,  when people's sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were  witnesses to their judgment. 
21|79|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We made Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We  gave judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His)  praise along with David. We were the doers (thereof). 
21|80|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail) to protect you in  your daring. Are ye then thankful ? 
21|81|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by his  command toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware. 
21|82|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And of the evil ones (subdued We unto him) some who dived (for pearls) for  him and did other work, and We were warders unto them. 
21|83|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying): Lo! adversity afflicteth me,  and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy. 
21|84|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he  suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along  with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers; 
21|85|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast. 
21|86|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous. 
21|87|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We  had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save  Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. 
21|88|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save  believers. 
21|89|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not  childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. 
21|90|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his  wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds,  and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. 
21|91|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our  Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. 
21|92|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. 
21|93|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all  are returning unto Us. 
21|94|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no  rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. 
21|95|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they  shall not return. 
21|96|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every  mound, 
21|97|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in  terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in  forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! 
21|98|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell.  Thereunto ye will come. 
21|99|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide  therein. 
21|100|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not. 
21|101|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be  far removed from thence. 
21|102|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which  their souls desire. 
21|103|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome  them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised; 
21|104|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written  scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding)  upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. 
21|105|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My  righteous slaves will inherit the earth: 
21|106|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout. 
21|107|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples. 
21|108|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Say: It is only inspired in me that your God is One God. Will ye then  surrender (unto Him) ? 
21|109|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know  not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised. 
21|110|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal. 
21|111|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a  while. 
21|112|al-Anbiya': The Prophets|He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent,  Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him). 
22|1|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|O mankind! Fear your Lord. Lo! the earthquake of the Hour (of Doom) is a  tremendous thing. 
22|2|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|On the day when ye behold it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling  and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden, and thou (Muhammad) wilt  see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but the Doom of Allah will be  strong (upon them). 
22|3|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge,  and followeth each froward devil; 
22|4|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend, he verily will mislead  him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame. 
22|5|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have  created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little  lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We  cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We  bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength.  And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is  brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth  naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water  thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind (of growth). 
22|6|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That is because Allah, He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead,  and because He is Able to do all things; 
22|7|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And because the Hour will come, there is no doubt thereof; and because  Allah will raise those who are in the graves. 
22|8|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without  knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light, 
22|9|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Turning away in pride to beguile (men) from the way of Allah. For him in  this world is ignominy, and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom  of burning. 
22|10|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|(And unto him it will be said): This is for that which thy two hands have sent  before, and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves. 
22|11|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so  that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth  away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss. 
22|12|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|He calleth, beside Allah, unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him.  That is the far error. 
22|13|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit; verily an evil  patron and verily an evil friend! 
22|14|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Lo! Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth. 
22|15|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Whoso is wont to think (through envy) that Allah will not give him  (Muhammad) victory in the world and the Hereafter (and is enraged at the thought of  his victory), let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang  himself. Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth!. 
22|16|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Thus We reveal it as plain revelations, and verily Allah guideth whom He  will. 
22|17|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Lo! those who believe (this revelation), and those who are Jews, and the  Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters - Lo! Allah will decide  between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Allah is Witness over all things. 
22|18|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the  heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and  the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there are many  unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none to give  him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will. 
22|19|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|These twain (the believers and the disbelievers) are two opponents who  contend concerning their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will  be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads, 
22|20|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; 
22|21|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And for them are hooked rods of iron. 
22|22|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven  back therein and (it is said unto them): Taste the doom of burning. 
22|23|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold, and  pearls, and their raiment therein will be silk. 
22|24|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|They are guided unto gentle speech; they are guided unto the path of the  Glorious One. 
22|25|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Lo! those who disbelieve and bar (men) from the way of Allah and from the  Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the  dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein, him  We shall cause to taste a painful doom. 
22|26|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place of the (holy)  House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me, and purify My House for  those who make the round (thereof) and those who stand and those who bow and  make prostration. 
22|27|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage. They will come unto thee on  foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine, 
22|28|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the  name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed upon  them. Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate. 
22|29|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go  around the ancient House. 
22|30|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it  will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you save that  which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying speech, 
22|31|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Turning unto Allah (only), not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso  ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had  snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place. 
22|32|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to  Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts, 
22|33|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term; and afterward they are  brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House. 
22|34|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And for every nation have We appointed a ritual, that they may mention the  name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He hath given them for food; and your God  is One God, therefor surrender unto Him. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to  the humble, 
22|35|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned, and the patient of whatever may  befall them, and those who establish worship and who spend of that We have  bestowed on them. 
22|36|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And the camels! We have appointed them among the ceremonies of Allah.  Therein ye have much good. So mention the name of Allah over them when they are  drawn up in lines. Then when their flanks fall (dead), eat thereof and feed the beggar  and the suppliant. Thus have We made them subject unto you, that haply ye may give  thanks. 
22|37|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Their flesh and their food reach not Allah, but the devotion from you  reacheth Him. Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah  that He hath guided you. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to the good. 
22|38|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true. Lo! Allah loveth not each  treacherous ingrate. 
22|39|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged; and  Allah is indeed Able to give them victory; 
22|40|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they  said: Our Lord is Allah - For had it not been for Allah's repelling some men by means  of others, cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of  Allah is oft mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth  one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty - 
22|41|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish worship and pay the  poor-due and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity. And Allah's is the sequel of events. 
22|42|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|If they deny thee (Muhammad), even so the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of)  A'ad and Thamud, before thee, denied (Our messengers); 
22|43|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot; 
22|44|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|(And) the dwellers in Midian. And Moses was denied; but I indulged the  disbelievers a long while, then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My abhorrence! 
22|45|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lieth  (to this day) in ruins, and (how many) a deserted well and lofty tower! 
22|46|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel  and ears wherewith to hear ? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the  hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind. 
22|47|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And they will bid thee hasten on the Doom, and Allah faileth not His  promise, but lo! a Day with Allah is as a thousand years of what ye reckon. 
22|48|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And how many a township did I suffer long though it was sinful! Then I  grasped it. Unto Me is the return. 
22|49|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Say: O mankind! I am only a plain warner unto you. 
22|50|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and a rich  provision; 
22|51|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|While those who strive to thwart Our revelations, such are rightful owners of  the Fire. 
22|52|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the  message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But  Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations.  Allah is Knower, Wise; 
22|53|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That He may make that which the devil proposeth a temptation for those in  whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened - Lo! the evil-doers are  in open schism - 
22|54|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth  from thy Lord, so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit humbly  unto Him. Lo! Allah verily is guiding those who believe unto a right path. 
22|55|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour  come upon them unawares, or there come unto them the doom of a disastrous day. 
22|56|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|The Sovereignty on that day will be Allah's, He will judge between them.  Then those who believed and did good works will be in Gardens of Delight, 
22|57|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|While those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, for them will be a  shameful doom. 
22|58|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or  died, Allah verily will provide for them a good provision. Lo! Allah, He verily is Best  of all who make provision. 
22|59|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love. Lo!  Allah verily is Knower, Indulgent. 
22|60|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That (is so). And whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was  made to suffer and then hath (again) been wronged, Allah will succour him. Lo! Allah  verily is Mild, Forgiving. 
22|61|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the  day to pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer. 
22|62|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|That is because Allah, He is the True, and that whereon they call instead of  Him, it is the false, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great. 
22|63|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Seest thou not how Allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the  earth becometh green upon the morrow ? Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware. 
22|64|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Lo!  Allah, He verily is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. 
22|65|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Hast thou not seen how Allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient  unto you ? And the ship runneth upon the sea by His command, and He holdeth back  the heaven from falling on the earth unless by His leave. Lo! Allah is, for mankind,  Full of Pity, Merciful. 
22|66|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and then will  give you life (again). Lo! man is verily an ingrate. 
22|67|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so  let them not dispute with thee of the matter, but summon thou unto thy Lord. Lo! thou  indeed followest right guidance. 
22|68|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And if they wrangle with thee, say: Allah is Best Aware of what ye do. 
22|69|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that  wherein ye used to differ. 
22|70|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the  earth ? Lo! it is in a record. Lo! that is easy for Allah. 
22|71|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no  warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no helper. 
22|72|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And when Our revelations are recited unto them, thou knowest the denial in  the faces of those who disbelieve; they all but attack those who recite Our revelations  unto them. Say: Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that ? The Fire! Allah hath  promised it for those who disbelieve. A hapless journey's end! 
22|73|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|O mankind! A similitude is coined, so pay ye heed to it: Lo! those on whom  ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for the  purpose. And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it from it. So  weak are (both) the seeker and the sought! 
22|74|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|They measure not Allah His rightful measure. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty. 
22|75|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|Allah chooseth from the angels messengers, and (also) from mankind. Lo!  Allah is Hearer, Seer. 
22|76|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them, and unto  Allah all things are returned. 
22|77|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your  Lord, and do good, that haply ye may prosper. 
22|78|al-Hajj: The Pilgrimage|And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen  you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father  Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture),  that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses  against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast to Allah. He is  your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper! 
23|1|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Successful indeed are the believers 
23|2|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Who are humble in their prayers, 
23|3|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And who shun vain conversation, 
23|4|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And who are payers of the poor-due; 
23|5|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And who guard their modesty - 
23|6|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then  they are not blameworthy, 
23|7|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors - 
23|8|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant, 
23|9|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And who pay heed to their prayers. 
23|10|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|These are the heirs 
23|11|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide. 
23|12|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Verily We created man from a product of wet earth; 
23|13|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then placed him as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging; 
23|14|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump,  then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then  produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! 
23|15|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then lo! after that ye surely die. 
23|16|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised (again). 
23|17|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of  creation. 
23|18|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in  the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it. 
23|19|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes,  wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat; 
23|20|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish  for the eaters. 
23|21|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of  that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat; 
23|22|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And on them and on the ship ye are carried. 
23|23|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve  Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
23|24|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal  like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could  have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old. 
23|25|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while. 
23|26|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. 
23|27|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our  inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce  therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against  whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those  who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned. 
23|28|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say:  Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk! 
23|29|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art  Best of all who bring to land. 
23|30|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the  test. 
23|31|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then, after them, We brought forth another generation; 
23|32|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye  have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
23|33|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the  Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a  mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink. 
23|34|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be  losers. 
23|35|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and  bones, will (again) be brought forth ? 
23|36|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised! 
23|37|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall  not be raised (again). 
23|38|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to  put faith in him. 
23|39|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. 
23|40|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant. 
23|41|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as  wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk! 
23|42|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then after them We brought forth other generations. 
23|43|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it. 
23|44|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger  came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to  disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not! 
23|45|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear  warrant 
23|46|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic  folk. 
23|47|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose  folk are servile unto us ? 
23|48|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed. 
23|49|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright. 
23|50|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them  refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings. 
23|51|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of  what ye do. 
23|52|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your  duty unto Me. 
23|53|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects, each  group rejoicing in its tenets. 
23|54|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|So leave them in their error till a time. 
23|55|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them 
23|56|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|We hasten unto them with good things ? Nay, but they perceive not. 
23|57|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord. 
23|58|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord, 
23|59|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord, 
23|60|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are  about to return unto their Lord, 
23|61|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race. 
23|62|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which  speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged. 
23|63|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this (Qur'an), and they have other  works, besides, which they are doing; 
23|64|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they  supplicate. 
23|65|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us. 
23|66|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels, 
23|67|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together. 
23|68|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came  not unto their fathers of old ? 
23|69|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him ? 
23|70|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Or say they: There is a madness in him ? Nay, but he bringeth them the  Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth. 
23|71|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth  and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their  Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away. 
23|72|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Or dost thou ask of them (O Muhammad) any tribute ? But the bounty of thy  Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision. 
23|73|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path. 
23|74|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the  path. 
23|75|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting  them, they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy. 
23|76|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not  themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray, 
23|77|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they  are aghast thereat. 
23|78|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give  ye! 
23|79|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will  be gathered. 
23|80|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of  night and day. Have ye then no sense ? 
23|81|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old; 
23|82|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They say: When we are dead and have become (mere) dust and bones, shall  we then, forsooth, be raised again ? 
23|83|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but  fables of the men of old. 
23|84|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have  knowledge ? 
23|85|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember ? 
23|86|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne  ? 
23|87|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep  duty (unto Him) ? 
23|88|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while  against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge ? 
23|89|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye  bewitched ? 
23|90|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. 
23|91|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else  would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them  would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege. 
23|92|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! and Exalted be He over all that they  ascribe as partners (unto Him)! 
23|93|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Say: My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised. 
23|94|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk. 
23|95|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them. 
23|96|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they  allege. 
23|97|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones, 
23|98|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me, 
23|99|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me  back, 
23|100|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word  that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised. 
23|101|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that  day, nor will they ask of one another. 
23|102|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. 
23|103|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell  abiding. 
23|104|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein. 
23|105|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|(It will be said): Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used  to deny them ? 
23|106|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring  folk. 
23|107|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return (to evil) then indeed  we shall be wrong-doers. 
23|108|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me. 
23|109|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefor  forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy; 
23|110|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget  remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them. 
23|111|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that  they, even they, are the triumphant. 
23|112|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years ? 
23|113|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep  count! 
23|114|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew. 
23|115|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not  be returned unto Us ? 
23|116|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|Now Allah be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord  of the Throne of Grace. 
23|117|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof. His  reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful. 
23|118|al-Mu'minun: The Believers|And (O Muhammad) say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art  Best of all who show mercy. 
24|1|an-Nur: The Light|(Here is) a surah which We have revealed and enjoined, and wherein We  have revealed plain tokens, that haply ye may take heed. 
24|2|an-Nur: The Light|The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them (with) a  hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah,  if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their  punishment. 
24|3|an-Nur: The Light|The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the  adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto  believers. 
24|4|an-Nur: The Light|And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses,  scourge them (with) eighty stripes and never (afterward) accept their testimony - They  indeed are evil-doers - 
24|5|an-Nur: The Light|Save those who afterward repent and make amends. (For such) lo! Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
24|6|an-Nur: The Light|As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except  themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing) by Allah  that he is of those who speak the truth; 
24|7|an-Nur: The Light|And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie. 
24|8|an-Nur: The Light|And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah  four times that the thing he saith is indeed false, 
24|9|an-Nur: The Light|And a fifth (time) that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaketh truth. 
24|10|an-Nur: The Light|And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that  Allah is Clement, Wise, (ye had been undone). 
24|11|an-Nur: The Light|Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad  thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that  which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share  therein, his will be an awful doom. 
24|12|an-Nur: The Light|Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of  their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth ? 
24|13|an-Nur: The Light|Why did they not produce four witnesses ? Since they produce not witnesses,  they verily are liars in the sight of Allah. 
24|14|an-Nur: The Light|Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world  and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured. 
24|15|an-Nur: The Light|When ye welcomed it with your tongues, and uttered with your mouths that  whereof ye had no knowledge, ye counted it a trifle. In the sight of Allah it is very  great. 
24|16|an-Nur: The Light|Wherefor, when ye heard it, said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this.  Glory be to Thee (O Allah)! This is awful calumny. 
24|17|an-Nur: The Light|Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever, if ye are (in  truth) believers. 
24|18|an-Nur: The Light|And He expoundeth unto you the revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
24|19|an-Nur: The Light|Lo! those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who  believe, theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter. Allah  knoweth. Ye know not. 
24|20|an-Nur: The Light|Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah  is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone). 
24|21|an-Nur: The Light|O ye who believe! Follow not the footsteps of the devil. Unto whomsoever  followeth the footsteps of the devil, lo! he commandeth filthiness and wrong. Had it  not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, not one of you would ever  have grown pure. But Allah causeth whom He will to grow. And Allah is Hearer,  Knower. 
24|22|an-Nur: The Light|And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give  to the near of kin and to the needy, and to fugitives for the cause of Allah. Let them  forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you ? Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
24|23|an-Nur: The Light|Lo! as for those who traduce virtuous, believing women (who are) careless,  cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter. Theirs will be an awful doom 
24|24|an-Nur: The Light|On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against  them as to what they used to do, 
24|25|an-Nur: The Light|On that day Allah will pay them their just due, and they will know that Allah,  He is the Manifest Truth. 
24|26|an-Nur: The Light|Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are  for good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people  say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision. 
24|27|an-Nur: The Light|O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first  announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That is better for  you, that ye may be heedful. 
24|28|an-Nur: The Light|And if ye find no-one therein, still enter not until permission hath been given.  And if it be said unto you: Go away again, then go away, for it is purer for you. Allah  knoweth what ye do. 
24|29|an-Nur: The Light|(It is) no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you.  Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide. 
24|30|an-Nur: The Light|Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for  them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do. 
24|31|an-Nur: The Light|And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to  display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over  their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers  or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or their  brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who  lack vigour, or children who know naught of women's nakedness. And let them not  stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto  Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed. 
24|32|an-Nur: The Light|And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maid- servants. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of ample  means, Aware. 
24|33|an-Nur: The Light|And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them  independence by His grace. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of  emancipation), write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and bestow  upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force not your  slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world, if they  would preserve their chastity. And if one force them, then (unto them), after their  compulsion, lo! Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful. 
24|34|an-Nur: The Light|And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain, and the  example of those who passed away before you. An admonition unto those who ward  off (evil). 
24|35|an-Nur: The Light|Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is  as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a shining  star. (This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the  West, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light  upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will. And Allah speaketh to  mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things. 
24|36|an-Nur: The Light|(This lamp is found) in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and  that His name shall be remembered therein. Therein do offer praise to Him at morn  and evening. 
24|37|an-Nur: The Light|Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of  Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when  hearts and eyeballs will be overturned; 
24|38|an-Nur: The Light|That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did, and increase  reward for them of His bounty. Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will. 
24|39|an-Nur: The Light|As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a desert. The  thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught, and  findeth, in the place thereof, Allah Who payeth him his due; and Allah is swift at  reckoning. 
24|40|an-Nur: The Light|Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above  which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he  holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not appointed  light, for him there is no light. 
24|41|an-Nur: The Light|Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and  the earth praise, and the birds in their flight ? Of each He knoweth verily the worship  and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do. 
24|42|an-Nur: The Light|And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and  unto Allah is the journeying. 
24|43|an-Nur: The Light|Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds, then gathereth them, then  maketh them layers, and thou seest the rain come forth from between them; He  sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, and smiteth therewith  whom He will, and averteth it from whom He will. The flashing of His lightning all  but snatcheth away the sight. 
24|44|an-Nur: The Light|Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night. Lo! herein is indeed a  lesson for those who see. 
24|45|an-Nur: The Light|Allah hath created every animal of water. Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon  its belly and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs and (a kind) that goeth upon four.  Allah createth what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 
24|46|an-Nur: The Light|Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them. Allah guideth  whom He will unto a straight path. 
24|47|an-Nur: The Light|And they say: We believe in Allah and the messenger, and we obey; then  after that a faction of them turn away. Such are not believers. 
24|48|an-Nur: The Light|And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them,  lo! a faction of them are averse; 
24|49|an-Nur: The Light|But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly. 
24|50|an-Nur: The Light|Is there in their hearts a disease, or have they doubts, or fear they lest Allah  and His messenger should wrong them in judgment ? Nay, but such are evil-doers. 
24|51|an-Nur: The Light|The saying of (all true) believers when they appeal unto Allah and His  messenger to judge between them is only that they say: We hear and we obey. And  such are the successful. 
24|52|an-Nur: The Light|He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger, and feareth Allah, and keepeth  duty (unto Him): such indeed are the victorious. 
24|53|an-Nur: The Light|They swear by Allah solemnly that, if thou order them, they will go forth.  Say: Swear not; known obedience (is better). Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
24|54|an-Nur: The Light|Say: Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if ye turn away, then (it is) for  him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged, and for you (to do) only that  wherewith ye have been charged. If ye obey him, ye will go aright. But the messenger  hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly. 
24|55|an-Nur: The Light|Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will  surely make them to succeed (the present rulers) in the earth even as He caused those  who were before them to succeed (others); and that He will surely establish for them  their religion which He hath approved for them, and will give them in exchange  safety after their fear. They serve Me. They ascribe no thing as partner unto Me.  Those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the miscreants. 
24|56|an-Nur: The Light|Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply  ye may find mercy. 
24|57|an-Nur: The Light|Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Fire will be their home  - a hapless journey's end! 
24|58|an-Nur: The Light|O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to  puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before they come into your presence): Before  the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon, and after  the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no sin for them or for you at  other times, when some of you go round attendant upon others (if they come into your  presence without leave). Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you. Allah is  Knower, Wise. 
24|59|an-Nur: The Light|And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave  even as those before them used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for  you. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
24|60|an-Nur: The Light|As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin  for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment.  But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
24|61|an-Nur: The Light|No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame  upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your  fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of  your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the houses of your fathers'  sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers' sisters,  or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it  be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one  another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His  revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. 
24|62|an-Nur: The Light|They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger  and, when they are with him on some common errand, go not away until they have  asked leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, those are they who believe in  Allah and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give leave  to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
24|63|an-Nur: The Light|Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of  another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let  those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall  them. 
24|64|an-Nur: The Light|Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth.  He knoweth your condition. And (He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto  Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things. 
25|1|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion (of right and  wrong), that he may be a warner to the peoples. 
25|2|al-Furqan: The Criterion|He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He  hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created  everything and hath meted out for it a measure. 
25|3|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves  created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death nor life,  nor power to raise the dead. 
25|4|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Those who disbelieve say: This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and  other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a lie. 
25|5|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And they say: Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so  that they are dictated to him morn and evening. 
25|6|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He who knoweth the secret of the heavens  and the earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful. 
25|7|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And they say: What aileth this messenger (of Allah) that he eateth food and  walketh in the markets ? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with  him. 
25|8|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Or (why is not) treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a  paradise from whence to eat ? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man  bewitched. 
25|9|al-Furqan: The Criterion|See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and cannot  find a road! 
25|10|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than (all) that - Gardens  underneath which rivers flow  - and will assign thee mansions. 
25|11|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Nay, but they deny (the coming of) the Hour, and for those who deny (the  coming of) the Hour We have prepared a flame. 
25|12|al-Furqan: The Criterion|When it seeth them from afar, they hear the crackling and the roar thereof. 
25|13|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they  pray for destruction there. 
25|14|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions! 
25|15|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Say: Is that (doom) better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised  unto those who ward off (evil) ? It will be their reward and journey's end. 
25|16|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Therein abiding, they have all that they desire. It is for thy Lord a promise  that must be fulfilled. 
25|17|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship  instead of Allah and will say: Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they  (themselves) wander from the way ? 
25|18|al-Furqan: The Criterion|They will say: Be Thou Glorified! it was not for us to choose any protecting  friends beside thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the  warning and became lost folk. 
25|19|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye can neither  avert (the doom) nor obtain help. And whoso among you doeth wrong, We shall make  him taste great torment. 
25|20|al-Furqan: The Criterion|We never sent before thee any messengers but lo! they verily ate food and  walked in the markets. And We have appointed some of you a test for others: Will ye  be steadfast ? And thy Lord is ever Seer. 
25|21|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: Why are angels not sent  down unto us and (Why) do we not see our Lord! Assuredly they think too highly of  themselves and are scornful with great pride. 
25|22|al-Furqan: The Criterion|On the day when they behold the angels, on that day there will be no good  tidings for the guilty; and they will cry: A forbidding ban! 
25|23|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes. 
25|24|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home  and happier in their place of noonday rest; 
25|25|al-Furqan: The Criterion|A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels  will be sent down, a grand descent. 
25|26|al-Furqan: The Criterion|The Sovereignty on that day will be the True (Sovereignty) belonging to the  Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers. 
25|27|al-Furqan: The Criterion|On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands, he will say: Ah, would  that I had chosen a way together with the messenger (of Allah)! 
25|28|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one for friend! 
25|29|al-Furqan: The Criterion|He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan  was ever man's deserter in the hour of need. 
25|30|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And the messenger saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of  no account. 
25|31|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the  guilty; but Allah sufficeth for a Guide and Helper. 
25|32|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at  once ? (It is revealed) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We have  arranged it in right order. 
25|33|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth (as against it),  and better (than their similitude) as argument. 
25|34|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in plight  and further from the right road. 
25|35|al-Furqan: The Criterion|We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron  as henchman. 
25|36|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations.  Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction. 
25|37|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And Noah's folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and  made of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers. 
25|38|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many  generations in between. 
25|39|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Each (of them) We warned by examples, and each (of them) We brought to  utter ruin. 
25|40|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal  rain. Can it be that they have not seen it ? Nay, but they hope for no resurrection. 
25|41|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And when they see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest  (saying): Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger ? 
25|42|al-Furqan: The Criterion|He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to  them. They will know, when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road. 
25|43|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust ? Wouldst thou  then be guardian over him ? 
25|44|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand ? They are but as the  cattle - nay, but they are farther astray ? 
25|45|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade - And if He willed He  could have made it still - then We have made the sun its pilot; 
25|46|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal ? 
25|47|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you, and sleep repose, and  maketh day a resurrection. 
25|48|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy, and  We send down purifying water from the sky, 
25|49|al-Furqan: The Criterion|That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give many beasts and  men that We have created to drink thereof. 
25|50|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember, but  most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude. 
25|51|al-Furqan: The Criterion|If We willed, We could raise up a warner in every village. 
25|52|al-Furqan: The Criterion|So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith with a great  endeavour. 
25|53|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas (though they  meet); one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar and a  forbidding ban between them. 
25|54|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And He it is Who hath created man from water, and hath appointed for him  kindred by blood and kindred by marriage; for thy Lord is ever Powerful. 
25|55|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Yet they worship instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor  hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord. 
25|56|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And We have sent thee (O Muhammad) only as a bearer of good tidings and  a warner. 
25|57|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way  unto his Lord. 
25|58|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And trust thou in the Living One Who dieth not, and hymn His praise. He  sufficeth as the Knower of His bondmen's sins, 
25|59|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six  Days, then He mounted the Throne. The Beneficent! Ask anyone informed  concerning Him! 
25|60|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And when it is said unto them: Adore the Beneficent! they say: And what is  the Beneficent ? Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us ? And it  increaseth aversion in them. 
25|61|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Blessed be He Who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars, and hath  placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light! 
25|62|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And He it is Who hath appointed night and day in succession, for him who  desireth to remember, or desireth thankfulness. 
25|63|al-Furqan: The Criterion|The (faithful) slaves of the Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth  modestly, and when the foolish ones address them answer: Peace; 
25|64|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing, 
25|65|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And who say: Our Lord! Avert from us the doom of hell; lo! the doom  thereof is anguish; 
25|66|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Lo! it is wretched as abode and station; 
25|67|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who, when they spend, are neither prodigal nor grudging; and  there is ever a firm station between the two; 
25|68|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life  which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery - and  whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty; 
25|69|al-Furqan: The Criterion|The doom will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will  abide therein disdained for ever; 
25|70|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Save him who repenteth and believeth and doth righteous work; as for such,  Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
25|71|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And whosoever repenteth and doeth good, he verily repenteth toward Allah  with true repentance - 
25|72|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who will not witness vanity, but when they pass near senseless  play, pass by with dignity. 
25|73|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And those who, when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, fall  not deaf and blind thereat. 
25|74|al-Furqan: The Criterion|And who say: Our Lord! Vouchsafe us comfort of our wives and of our  offspring, and make us patterns for (all) those who ward off (evil). 
25|75|al-Furqan: The Criterion|They will be awarded the high place forasmuch as they were steadfast, and  they will meet therein with welcome and the ward of peace, 
25|76|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Abiding there for ever. Happy is it as abode and station! 
25|77|al-Furqan: The Criterion|Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): My Lord would not concern  Himself with you but for your prayer. But now ye have denied (the Truth), therefor  there will be judgment. 
26|1|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Ta. Sin. Mim. 
26|2|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. 
26|3|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe  not. 
26|4|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their  necks would remain bowed before it. 
26|5|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but  they turn away from it. 
26|6|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of  that whereat they used to scoff. 
26|7|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to  grow therein ? 
26|8|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 
26|9|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|10|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, 
26|11|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? 
26|12|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, 
26|13|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor  send for Aaron (to help me). 
26|14|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. 
26|15|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with  you, Hearing. 
26|16|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord  of the Worlds, 
26|17|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. 
26|18|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And  thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, 
26|19|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the  ingrates. 
26|20|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. 
26|21|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a  command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). 
26|22|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast  enslaved the Children of Israel. 
26|23|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? 
26|24|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them,  if ye had but sure belief. 
26|25|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? 
26|26|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. 
26|27|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a  madman! 
26|28|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did  but understand. 
26|29|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place  thee among the prisoners. 
26|30|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? 
26|31|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! 
26|32|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, 
26|33|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. 
26|34|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing  wizard, 
26|35|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? 
26|36|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities  summoners 
26|37|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. 
26|38|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. 
26|39|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? 
26|40|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. 
26|41|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a  reward for us if we are the winners ? 
26|42|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). 
26|43|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! 
26|44|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's  might, lo! we verily are the winners. 
26|45|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely  show. 
26|46|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And the wizards were flung prostrate, 
26|47|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, 
26|48|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The Lord of Moses and Aaron. 
26|49|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he  doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know.  Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you  every one. 
26|50|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. 
26|51|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are  the first of the believers. 
26|52|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will  be pursued. 
26|53|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, 
26|54|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, 
26|55|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! they are offenders against us. 
26|56|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! we are a ready host. 
26|57|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, 
26|58|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And treasures and a fair estate. 
26|59|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit them. 
26|60|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And they overtook them at sunrise. 
26|61|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are  indeed caught. 
26|62|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. 
26|63|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted,  and each part was as a mountain vast. 
26|64|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then brought We near the others to that place. 
26|65|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; 
26|66|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We drowned the others. 
26|67|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
26|68|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|69|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Recite unto them the story of Abraham: 
26|70|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? 
26|71|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. 
26|72|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? 
26|73|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Or do they benefit or harm you ? 
26|74|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. 
26|75|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: See now that which ye worship, 
26|76|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Ye and your forefathers! 
26|77|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, 
26|78|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Who created me, and He doth guide me, 
26|79|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And Who feedeth me and watereth me. 
26|80|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And when I sicken, then He healeth me, 
26|81|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), 
26|82|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. 
26|83|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. 
26|84|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And give unto me a good report in later generations. 
26|85|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, 
26|86|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. 
26|87|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And abase me not on the day when they are raised, 
26|88|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) 
26|89|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. 
26|90|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). 
26|91|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And hell will appear plainly to the erring. 
26|92|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship 
26|93|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? 
26|94|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers 
26|95|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And the hosts of Iblis, together. 
26|96|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: 
26|97|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest 
26|98|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. 
26|99|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|It was but the guilty who misled us. 
26|100|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Now we have no intercessors 
26|101|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Nor any loving friend. 
26|102|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! 
26|103|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! 
26|104|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|105|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), 
26|106|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
26|107|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
26|108|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
26|109|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
26|110|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
26|111|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow  thee ? 
26|112|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in  the past) ? 
26|113|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; 
26|114|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I am not (here) to repulse believers. 
26|115|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|I am only a plain warner. 
26|116|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned  (to death). 
26|117|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. 
26|118|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and  those believers who are with me. 
26|119|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. 
26|120|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then afterward We drowned the others. 
26|121|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
26|122|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|123|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). 
26|124|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
26|125|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
26|126|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
26|127|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
26|128|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? 
26|129|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? 
26|130|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? 
26|131|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
26|132|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that  ye know, 
26|133|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Hath aided you with cattle and sons. 
26|134|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And gardens and watersprings. 
26|135|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. 
26|136|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who  preach; 
26|137|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|This is but a fable of the men of old, 
26|138|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And we shall not be doomed. 
26|139|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a  portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
26|140|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|141|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) 
26|142|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
26|143|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
26|144|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
26|145|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
26|146|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, 
26|147|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|In gardens and watersprings. 
26|148|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, 
26|149|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? 
26|150|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, 
26|151|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And obey not the command of the prodigal, 
26|152|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. 
26|153|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 
26|154|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. 
26|155|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well),  and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. 
26|156|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful  day. 
26|157|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. 
26|158|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of  them are not believers. 
26|159|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|160|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), 
26|161|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
26|162|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
26|163|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
26|164|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. 
26|165|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, 
26|166|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward  folk. 
26|167|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. 
26|168|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. 
26|169|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. 
26|170|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So We saved him and his household, every one, 
26|171|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. 
26|172|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then afterward We destroyed the others. 
26|173|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have  been warned. 
26|174|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 
26|175|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|176|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), 
26|177|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
26|178|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 
26|179|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
26|180|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of  the Worlds. 
26|181|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). 
26|182|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And weigh with the true balance. 
26|183|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the  earth. 
26|184|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the  men of old. 
26|185|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 
26|186|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. 
26|187|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. 
26|188|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. 
26|189|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of  gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. 
26|190|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 
26|191|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|192|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, 
26|193|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Which the True Spirit hath brought down 
26|194|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, 
26|195|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|In plain Arabic speech. 
26|196|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. 
26|197|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? 
26|198|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, 
26|199|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. 
26|200|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. 
26|201|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, 
26|202|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. 
26|203|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? 
26|204|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? 
26|205|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, 
26|206|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And then cometh that which they were promised, 
26|207|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|(How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? 
26|208|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And We destroyed no township but it had its warners 
26|209|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|For reminder, for We never were oppressors. 
26|210|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|The devils did not bring it down. 
26|211|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, 
26|212|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. 
26|213|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. 
26|214|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And warn thy tribe of near kindred, 
26|215|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. 
26|216|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they  do. 
26|217|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. 
26|218|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) 
26|219|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). 
26|220|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. 
26|221|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? 
26|222|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They descend on every sinful, false one. 
26|223|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. 
26|224|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|As for poets, the erring follow them. 
26|225|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, 
26|226|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|And how they say that which they do not ? 
26|227|ash-Shu`ara': The Poets|Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and  vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come  to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned! 
27|1|an-Naml: The Ant|Ta. Sin. These are revelations of the Qur'an and a Scripture that maketh  plain; 
27|2|an-Naml: The Ant|A guidance and good tidings for believers 
27|3|an-Naml: The Ant|Who establish worship and pay the poor-due and are sure of the Hereafter. 
27|4|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! as for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their works  fairseeming unto them so that they are all astray. 
27|5|an-Naml: The Ant|Those are they for whom is the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter  they will be the greatest losers. 
27|6|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! as for thee (Muhammad), thou verily receivest the Qur'an from the  presence of One Wise, Aware. 
27|7|an-Naml: The Ant|(Remember) when Moses said unto his household: Lo! I spy afar off a fire; I  will bring you tidings thence, or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm  yourselves. 
27|8|an-Naml: The Ant|But when he reached it, he was called, saying: Blessed is Whosoever is in the  fire and Whosoever is round about it! And Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the  Worlds! 
27|9|an-Naml: The Ant|O Moses! Lo! it is I, Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. 
27|10|an-Naml: The Ant|And throw down thy staff! But when he saw it writhing as it were a demon,  he turned to flee headlong; (but it was said unto him): O Moses! Fear not! the  emissaries fear not in My presence, 
27|11|an-Naml: The Ant|Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good.  And lo! I am Forgiving, Merciful. 
27|12|an-Naml: The Ant|And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe, it will come forth white but  unhurt. (This will be one) among nine tokens unto Pharaoh and his people Lo! they  were ever evil-living folk. 
27|13|an-Naml: The Ant|But when Our tokens came unto them, plain to see, they said: This is mere  magic, 
27|14|an-Naml: The Ant|And they denied them, though their souls acknowledged them, for spite and  arrogance. Then see the nature of the consequence for the wrong-doers! 
27|15|an-Naml: The Ant|And We verily gave knowledge unto David and Solomon, and they said:  Praise be to Allah, Who hath preferred us above many of His believing slaves! 
27|16|an-Naml: The Ant|And Solomon was David's heir. And he said: O mankind! Lo! we have been  taught the language of birds, and have been given (abundance) of all things. This  surely is evident favour. 
27|17|an-Naml: The Ant|And there were gathered together unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and  humankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order; 
27|18|an-Naml: The Ant|Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant exclaimed: O ants!  Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you, unperceiving. 
27|19|an-Naml: The Ant|And (Solomon) smiled, laughing at her speech, and said: My Lord, arouse  me to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents,  and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee, and include me in (the number of)  Thy righteous slaves. 
27|20|an-Naml: The Ant|And he sought among the birds and said: How is it that I see not the hoopoe,  or is he among the absent ? 
27|21|an-Naml: The Ant|I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him, or he  verily shall bring me a plain excuse. 
27|22|an-Naml: The Ant|But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that  thou apprehendest not, and I come unto thee from Sheba with sure tidings. 
27|23|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! I found a woman ruling over them, and she hath been given (abundance)  of all things, and hers is a mighty throne. 
27|24|an-Naml: The Ant|I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan  maketh their works fairseeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way (of  Truth), so that they go not aright; 
27|25|an-Naml: The Ant|So that they worship not Allah, Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens  and the earth, and knoweth what ye hide and what ye proclaim, 
27|26|an-Naml: The Ant|Allah; there is no God save Him, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. 
27|27|an-Naml: The Ant|(Solomon) said: We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art  of the liars. 
27|28|an-Naml: The Ant|Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them; then turn away and see  what (answer) they return, 
27|29|an-Naml: The Ant|(The Queen of Sheba) said (when she received the letter): O chieftains! Lo!  there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter. 
27|30|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent,  the Merciful; 
27|31|an-Naml: The Ant|Exalt not yourselves against me, but come unto me as those who surrender. 
27|32|an-Naml: The Ant|She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case. I decide no case till ye  are present with me. 
27|33|an-Naml: The Ant|They said: We are lords of might and lords of great prowess, but it is for thee  to command; so consider what thou wilt command. 
27|34|an-Naml: The Ant|She said: Lo! kings, when they enter a township, ruin it and make the honour  of its people shame. Thus will they do. 
27|35|an-Naml: The Ant|But lo! I am going to send a present unto them, and to see with what  (answer) the messengers return. 
27|36|an-Naml: The Ant|So when (the envoy) came unto Solomon, (the King) said: What! Would ye  help me with wealth ? But that which Allah hath given me is better than that which  He hath given you. Nay it is ye (and not I) who exult in your gift. 
27|37|an-Naml: The Ant|Return unto them. We verily shall come unto them with hosts that they  cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from thence with shame, and they will be  abased. 
27|38|an-Naml: The Ant|He said: O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come  unto me, surrendering ? 
27|39|an-Naml: The Ant|A stalwart of the jinn said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from thy  place. Lo! I verily am strong and trusty for such work. 
27|40|an-Naml: The Ant|One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it thee  before thy gaze returneth unto thee. And when he saw it set in his presence,  (Solomon) said: This is of the bounty of my Lord, that He may try me whether I give  thanks or am ungrateful. Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for (the good  of) his own soul; and whosoever is ungrateful (is ungrateful only to his own soul's  hurt). For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence, Bountiful. 
27|41|an-Naml: The Ant|He said: Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go  aright or be of those not rightly guided. 
27|42|an-Naml: The Ant|So, when she came, it was said (unto her): Is thy throne like this ? She said:  (It is) as though it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the  knowledge before her and we had surrendered (to Allah). 
27|43|an-Naml: The Ant|And (all) that she was wont to worship instead of Allah hindered her, for she  came of disbelieving folk. 
27|44|an-Naml: The Ant|It was said unto her: Enter the hall. And when she saw it she deemed it a  pool and bared her legs. (Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass. She  said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself, and I surrender with Solomon unto Allah,  the Lord of the Worlds. 
27|45|an-Naml: The Ant|And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship Allah.  And lo! they (then  became two parties quarrelling. 
27|46|an-Naml: The Ant|He said: O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good ?  Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah, that ye may receive mercy. 
27|47|an-Naml: The Ant|They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee. He said: Your evil  augury is with Allah. Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested. 
27|48|an-Naml: The Ant|And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and  reformed not. 
27|49|an-Naml: The Ant|They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and  his household by night, and afterward we will surely say unto his friend: We  witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers. 
27|50|an-Naml: The Ant|So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. 
27|51|an-Naml: The Ant|Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed  them and their people, every one. 
27|52|an-Naml: The Ant|See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong.  Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge. 
27|53|an-Naml: The Ant|And we saved those who believed and used to ward off (evil). 
27|54|an-Naml: The Ant|And Lot! when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination  knowingly ? 
27|55|an-Naml: The Ant|Must ye needs lust after men instead of women ? Nay, but ye are folk who  act senselessly. 
27|56|an-Naml: The Ant|But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the  household of Lot from your township, for they (forsooth) are folk who would keep  clean! 
27|57|an-Naml: The Ant|Then We saved him and his household save his wife; We destined her to be  of those who stayed behind. 
27|58|an-Naml: The Ant|And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain of those who have  been warned. 
27|59|an-Naml: The Ant|Say (O Muhammad): Praise be to Allah, and peace be on His slaves whom  He hath chosen! Is Allah best, or (all) that ye ascribe as partners (unto Him) ? 
27|60|an-Naml: The Ant|Is not He (best) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for  you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards, whose  trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow. Is there any God beside Allah ? Nay,  but they are folk who ascribe equals (unto Him)! 
27|61|an-Naml: The Ant|Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the  folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas  ? Is there any God beside Allah ? Nay, but most of them know not! 
27|62|an-Naml: The Ant|Is not He (best) Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him  and removeth the evil, and hath made you viceroys of the earth ? Is there any God  beside Allah ? Little do they reflect! 
27|63|an-Naml: The Ant|Is not He (best) Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea, He  Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy ? Is there any God beside Allah ?  High Exalted be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! 
27|64|an-Naml: The Ant|Is not He (best) Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and Who  provideth for you from the heaven and the earth ? Is there any God beside Allah ?  Say: Bring your proof, if ye are truthful! 
27|65|an-Naml: The Ant|Say (O Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen  save Allah; and they know not when they will be raised (again). 
27|66|an-Naml: The Ant|Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter ? Nay, for they are in  doubt concerning it. Nay, for they cannot see it. 
27|67|an-Naml: The Ant|Yet those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust like our fathers,  shall we verily be brought forth (again) ? 
27|68|an-Naml: The Ant|We were promised this, forsooth, we and our fathers. (All) this is naught but  fables of the men of old. 
27|69|an-Naml: The Ant|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see the nature of the  sequel for the guilty! 
27|70|an-Naml: The Ant|And grieve thou not for them, nor be in distress because of what they plot  (against thee). 
27|71|an-Naml: The Ant|And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? 
27|72|an-Naml: The Ant|Say: It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind  you. 
27|73|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind, but most of them do not give  thanks. 
27|74|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide, and all that they  proclaim. 
27|75|an-Naml: The Ant|And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear  Record. 
27|76|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! this Qur'an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that concerning  which they differ. 
27|77|an-Naml: The Ant|And lo! it is a guidance and a mercy for believers. 
27|78|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! thy Lord will judge between them of His wisdom, and He is the Mighty,  the Wise. 
27|79|an-Naml: The Ant|Therefor (O Muhammad) put thy trust in Allah, for thou (standest) on the  plain Truth. 
27|80|an-Naml: The Ant|Lo! thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to  hear the call when they have turned to flee; 
27|81|an-Naml: The Ant|Nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to  hear, save those who believe Our revelations and who have surrendered. 
27|82|an-Naml: The Ant|And when the word is fulfilled concerning them, We shall bring forth a beast  of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in Our revelations. 
27|83|an-Naml: The Ant|And (remind them of) the Day when We shall gather out of every nation a  host of those who denied Our revelations, and they will be set in array; 
27|84|an-Naml: The Ant|Till, when they come (before their Lord), He will say: Did ye deny My  revelations when ye could not compass them in knowledge, or what was it that ye did  ? 
27|85|an-Naml: The Ant|And the Word will be fulfilled concerning them because they have done  wrong, and they will not speak. 
27|86|an-Naml: The Ant|Have they not seen how We have appointed the night that they may rest  therein, and the day sight-giving ? Lo! therein verily are portents for a people who  believe. 
27|87|an-Naml: The Ant|And (remind them of) the Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and all who  are in the heavens and the earth will start in fear, save him whom Allah willeth. And  all come unto Him, humbled. 
27|88|an-Naml: The Ant|And thou seest the hills thou deemest solid flying with the flight of clouds:  the doing of Allah Who perfecteth all things. Lo! He is Informed of what ye do. 
27|89|an-Naml: The Ant|Whoso bringeth a good deed will have better than its worth; and such are  safe from fear that Day. 
27|90|an-Naml: The Ant|And whoso bringeth an ill-deed, such will be flung down on their faces in the  Fire. Are ye rewarded aught save what ye did ? 
27|91|an-Naml: The Ant|(Say): I (Muhammad) am commanded only to serve the Lord of this land  which He hath hallowed, and unto Whom all things belong. And I am commanded to  be of those who surrender (unto Him), 
27|92|an-Naml: The Ant|And to recite the Qur'an. And whoso goeth right, goeth right only for (the  good of) his own soul; and as for him who goeth astray - (Unto him) say: Lo! I am  only a warner. 
27|93|an-Naml: The Ant|And say: Praise be to Allah Who will show you His portents so that ye shall  know them. And thy Lord is not unaware of what ye (mortals) do. 
28|1|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Ta. Sin. Mim. 
28|2|al-Qasas: The Narrative|These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. 
28|3|al-Qasas: The Narrative|We narrate unto thee (somewhat) of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with  truth, for folk who believe. 
28|4|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Lo! Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes. A tribe  among them he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Lo! he was of  those who work corruption. 
28|5|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth,  and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors, 
28|6|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their  hosts that which they feared from them. 
28|7|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: Suckle him and, when thou  fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve. Lo! We shall  bring him back unto thee and shall make him (one) of Our messengers. 
28|8|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an  enemy and a sorrow, Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning. 
28|9|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And the wife of Pharaoh said: (He will be) a consolation for me and for thee.  Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us, or we may choose him for a son.  And they perceived not. 
28|10|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And the heart of the mother of Moses became void, and she would have  betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart, that she might be of the believers. 
28|11|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And she said unto his sister: Trace him. So she observed him from afar, and  they perceived not. 
28|12|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We had before forbidden foster-mothers for him, so she said: Shall I  show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him ? 
28|13|al-Qasas: The Narrative|So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not  grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them  know not. 
28|14|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom  and knowledge. Thus do We reward the good. 
28|15|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found  therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies; and he  who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. So  Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of the devil's doing.  Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader. 
28|16|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul, so forgive me. Then He  forgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
28|17|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore  be a supporter of the guilty. 
28|18|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And morning found him in the city, fearing, vigilant, when behold! he who  had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said unto him:  Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead. 
28|19|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them  both, he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday.  Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the  reformers. 
28|20|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O  Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape. Lo! I am  of those who give thee good advice. 
28|21|al-Qasas: The Narrative|So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me  from the wrongdoing folk. 
28|22|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord  will guide me in the right road. 
28|23|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of  men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back (their  flocks). He said: What aileth you ? The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink  till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old man. 
28|24|al-Qasas: The Narrative|So he watered (their flock) for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and  said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me. 
28|25|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said:  Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou  didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the (whole)  story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk. 
28|26|al-Qasas: The Narrative|One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best (man) that  thou canst hire in the strong, the trustworthy. 
28|27|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine  on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for (the term of) eight pilgrimages. Then if  thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord, for I would not make it hard for  thee. Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous. 
28|28|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: That (is settled) between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I  fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say. 
28|29|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his  housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye (here).  Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence, or a  brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves. 
28|30|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley in the  blessed field, from the tree: O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; 
28|31|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon,  he turned to flee headlong, (and it was said unto him): O Moses! Draw nigh and fear  not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure. 
28|32|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without  hurt. And guard thy heart from fear. Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord  unto Pharaoh and his chiefs. Lo! they are evil-living folk. 
28|33|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will  kill me. 
28|34|al-Qasas: The Narrative|My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech. Therefor send him  with me as a helper to confirm me. Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me. 
28|35|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and We will give  unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for Our portents. Ye twain, and  those who follow you, will be the winners. 
28|36|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens, they said: This is  naught but invented magic. We never heard of this among our fathers of old. 
28|37|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And Moses said: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance from  His presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home (of bliss). Lo! wrong-doers  will not be successful. 
28|38|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And Pharaoh said: O chiefs! I know not that ye have a god other than me, so  kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in  order that I may survey the God of Moses; and lo! I deem him of the liars. 
28|39|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right, and deemed that  they would never be brought back to Us. 
28|40|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Therefor We seized him and his hosts, and abandoned them unto the sea.  Behold the nature of the consequence for evil-doers! 
28|41|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We made them patterns that invite unto the Fire, and on the Day of  Resurrection they will not be helped. 
28|42|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of  Resurrection they will be among the hateful. 
28|43|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We verily gave the Scripture unto Moses after We had destroyed the  generations of old: clear testimonies for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that  haply they might reflect. 
28|44|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And thou (Muhammad) wast not on the western side (of the Mount) when  We expounded unto Moses the commandment, and thou wast not among those  present; 
28|45|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But We brought forth generations, and their lives dragged on for them. And  thou wast not a dweller in Midian, reciting unto them Our revelations, but We kept  sending (messengers to men). 
28|46|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And thou was not beside the Mount when We did call; but (the knowledge of  it is) a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk unto whom no warner came  before thee, that haply they may give heed. 
28|47|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Otherwise, if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own  hands have sent before (them), they might say: Our Lord! Why sentest Thou no  messenger unto us, that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the  believers ? 
28|48|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But when there came unto them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Why  is he not given the like of what was given unto Moses ? Did they not disbelieve in  that which was given unto Moses of old ? They say: Two magics that support each  other; and they say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers. 
28|49|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then bring a scripture from the presence of  Allah that giveth clearer guidance than these two (that) I may follow it, if ye are  truthful. 
28|50|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And if they answer thee not, then know that what they follow is their lusts.  And who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance from  Allah. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
28|51|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them, that haply they  may give heed. 
28|52|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Those unto whom We gave the Scripture before it, they believe in it, 
28|53|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when it is recited unto them, they say: We believe in it. Lo! it is the  Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it we were of those who surrender (unto Him). 
28|54|al-Qasas: The Narrative|These will be given their reward twice over, because they are steadfast and  repel evil with good, and spend of that wherewith We have provided them, 
28|55|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say: Unto us our  works and unto you your works. Peace be unto you! We desire not the ignorant. 
28|56|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Lo! thou (O Muhammad) guidest not whom thou lovest, but Allah guideth  whom He will. And He is Best Aware of those who walk aright. 
28|57|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And they say: If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn  out of our land. Have We not established for them a sure sanctuary, whereunto the  produce of all things is brought (in trade), a provision from Our presence ? But most  of them know not. 
28|58|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And how many a community have We destroyed that was thankless for its  means of livelihood! And yonder are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited  after them save a little. And We, even We, were the inheritors. 
28|59|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And never did thy Lord destroy the townships, till He had raised up in their  mother(-town) a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations. And never did We  destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evil-doers. 
28|60|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And whatsoever ye have been given is a comfort of the life of the world and  an ornament thereof; and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting. Have ye  then no sense ? 
28|61|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find (true) like  him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world, then on the  Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned ? 
28|62|al-Qasas: The Narrative|On the day when He will call unto them and say: Where are My partners  whom ye imagined ? 
28|63|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say: Our Lord!  These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we ourselves were  astray. We declare our innocence before Thee: us they never worshipped. 
28|64|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And it will be said: Cry unto your (so-called) partners (of Allah). And they  will cry unto them, and they will give no answer unto them, and they will see the  Doom. Ah, if they had but been guided! 
28|65|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And on the Day when He will call unto them and say: What answer gave ye  to the messengers ? 
28|66|al-Qasas: The Narrative|On that day (all) tidings will be dimmed for them, nor will they ask one of  another, 
28|67|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right, he haply may be  one of the successful. 
28|68|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Thy Lord bringeth to pass what He willeth and chooseth. They have never  any choice. Glorified be Allah and Exalted above all that they associate (with Him)! 
28|69|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they publish. 
28|70|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And He is Allah; there is no God save Him. His is all praise in the former  and the latter (state), and His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. 
28|71|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made night everlasting for you till the Day of  Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you light ? Will ye not then  hear ? 
28|72|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made day everlasting for you till the Day of  Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you night wherein ye rest ?  Will ye not then see ? 
28|73|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day, that therein ye may  rest, and that ye may seek His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful. 
28|74|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My  partners whom ye pretended ? 
28|75|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say: Bring  your proof. Then they will know that Allah hath the Truth, and all that they invented  will have failed them. 
28|76|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so  much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of  mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the  exultant; 
28|77|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and  neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to  thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo! Allah loveth not corrupters, 
28|78|al-Qasas: The Narrative|He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew  he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were  mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following ? The guilty are not  questioned of their sins. 
28|79|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous  of the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what hath been given  unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune. 
28|80|al-Qasas: The Narrative|But those who had been given knowledge said: Woe unto you! The reward of  Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will  obtain it. 
28|81|al-Qasas: The Narrative|So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling-place. Then he had  no host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves. 
28|82|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying:  Ah, welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and  straiteneth it (for whom He will). If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would  have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper. 
28|83|al-Qasas: The Narrative|As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not  oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption. The sequel is for those who ward off  (evil). 
28|84|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Whoso bringeth a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as for  him who bringeth an ill-deed, those who do ill-deeds will be requited only what they  did. 
28|85|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law will surely bring thee home  again. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in  error manifest. 
28|86|al-Qasas: The Narrative|Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a  mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers. 
28|87|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have  been sent down unto thee; but call (mankind) unto thy Lord, and be not of those who  ascribe partners (unto Him). 
28|88|al-Qasas: The Narrative|And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him.  Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye  will be brought back. 
29|1|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Alif. Lam. Mim. 
29|2|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe,  and will not be tested with affliction ? 
29|3|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus Allah knoweth those who  are sincere, and knoweth those who feign. 
29|4|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us ? Evil (for  them) is that which they decide. 
29|5|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with Allah (let him know that) Allah's  reckoning is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
29|6|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And whosoever striveth, striveth only for himself, for lo! Allah is altogether  Independent of (His) creatures. 
29|7|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall remit from them  their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did. 
29|8|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make thee  join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is  your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do. 
29|9|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And as for those who believe and do good works, We verily shall make them  enter in among the righteous. 
29|10|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Of mankind is he who saith: We believe in Allah, but, if he be made to suffer  for the sake of Allah, he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for Allah's  punishment; and then, if victory cometh from thy Lord, will say: Lo! we were with  you (all the while). Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the bosoms of (His)  creatures ? 
29|11|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Verily Allah knoweth those who believe, and verily He knoweth the  hypocrites. 
29|12|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Follow our way (of  religion) and we verily will bear your sins (for you). They cannot bear aught of their  sins. Lo! they verily are liars. 
29|13|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own,  and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which  they invented. 
29|14|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And verily we sent Noah (as Our messenger) unto his folk, and he continued  with them for a thousand years save fifty years; and the flood engulfed them, for they  were wrong-doers. 
29|15|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made of it a portent  for the peoples. 
29|16|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And Abraham! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Serve Allah, and  keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know. 
29|17|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Ye serve instead of Allah only idols, and ye only invent a lie. Lo! those  whom ye serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision  from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him ye will be  brought back. 
29|18|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|But if ye deny, then nations have denied before you. The messenger is only  to convey (the message) plainly. 
29|19|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|See they not how Allah produceth creation, then reproduceth it ? Lo! for  Allah that is easy. 
29|20|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Say (O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see how He originated creation,  then Allah bringeth forth the later growth. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 
29|21|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will, and  unto Him ye will be turned. 
29|22|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Ye cannot escape (from Him) in the earth or in the sky, and beside Allah  there is for you no friend or helper. 
29|23|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in (their) Meeting with  Him, such have no hope of My mercy. For such there is a painful doom. 
29|24|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|But the answer of his folk was only that they said: "Kill him" or "Burn him."  Then Allah saved him from the Fire. Lo! herein verily are portents for folk who  believe. 
29|25|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|He said: Ye have chosen only idols instead of Allah. The love between you is  only in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other  and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and ye will have no helpers. 
29|26|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my Lord. Lo! He,  only He, is the Mighty, the Wise. 
29|27|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We established the  prophethood and the Scripture among his seed, and We gave him his reward in the  world, and lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous. 
29|28|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness  such as no creature did before you. 
29|29|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|For come ye not in unto males, and cut ye not the road (for travellers), and  commit ye not abomination in your meetings ? But the answer of his folk was only  that they said: Bring Allah's doom upon us if thou art a truthteller! 
29|30|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|He said: My Lord! Give me victory over folk who work corruption. 
29|31|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And when Our messengers brought Abraham the good news, they said: Lo!  we are about to destroy the people of that township, for its people are wrong-doers. 
29|32|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|He said: Lo! Lot is there. They said: We are best aware of who is there. We  are to deliver him and his household, all save his wife, who is of those who stay  behind. 
29|33|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled upon their  account, for he could not protect them; but they said: Fear not, nor grieve! Lo! we are  to deliver thee and thy household, (all) save thy wife, who is of those who stay  behind. 
29|34|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Lo! We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from  the sky because they are evil-livers. 
29|35|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people who have sense. 
29|36|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And unto Midian We sent Shu'eyb, their brother. He said: O my people!  Serve Allah, and look forward to the Last Day, and do not evil, making mischief, in  the earth. 
29|37|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|But they denied him, and the dreadful earthquake took them, and morning  found them prostrate in their dwelling place. 
29|38|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud! (Their fate) is manifest unto you from  their (ruined and deserted) dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and  so debarred them from the Way, though they were keen observers. 
29|39|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses came unto them with clear proofs  (of Allah's Sovereignty), but they were boastful in the land. And they were not  winners (in the race). 
29|40|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a  hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them  was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We  drowned. It was not for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves. 
29|41|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|The likeness of those who choose other patrons than Allah is as the likeness  of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all houses is  the spider's house, if they but knew. 
29|42|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Lo! Allah knoweth what thing they invoke instead of Him. He is the Mighty,  the Wise. 
29|43|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|As for these similitudes, We coin them for mankind, but none will grasp their  meaning save the wise. 
29|44|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Lo! therein is indeed a  portent for believers. 
29|45|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture, and establish  worship. Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity, but verily remembrance  of Allah is more important. And Allah knoweth what ye do. 
29|46|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in (a way) that is  better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in that which hath  been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God and your God is One, and unto  Him we surrender. 
29|47|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|In like manner We have revealed unto thee the Scripture, and those unto  whom We gave the Scripture aforetime will believe therein; and of these (also) there  are some who believe therein. And none deny Our revelations save the disbelievers. 
29|48|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And thou (O Muhammad) wast not a reader of any scripture before it, nor  didst thou write it with thy right hand, for then might those have doubted, who follow  falsehood. 
29|49|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given  knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save wrong-doers. 
29|50|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And they say: Why are not portents sent down upon him from his Lord ?  Say: Portents are with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner. 
29|51|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Scripture  which is read unto them ? Lo! herein verily is mercy, and a reminder for folk who  believe. 
29|52|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Allah sufficeth for witness between me and  you. He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe  in vanity and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers. 
29|53|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|They bid thee hasten on the doom (of Allah). And if a term had not been  appointed, the doom would assuredly have come unto them (ere now). And verily it  will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not. 
29|54|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|They bid thee hasten on the doom, when lo! hell verily will encompass the  disbelievers 
29|55|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|On the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from  underneath their feet, and He will say: Taste what ye used to do! 
29|56|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|O my bondmen who believe! Lo! My earth is spacious. Therefor serve Me  only. 
29|57|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Every soul will taste of death. Then unto Us ye will be returned. 
29|58|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Those who believe and do good works, them verily We shall house in lofty  dwellings of the Garden underneath which rivers flow. There they will dwell secure.  How sweet the guerdon of the toilers, 
29|59|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Who persevere, and put their trust in their Lord! 
29|60|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision! Allah  provideth for it and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
29|61|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and  constrained the sun and the moon (to their appointed work) ? they would say: Allah.  How then are they turned away ? 
29|62|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Allah maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen, and  straiteneth it for whom (He will). Lo! Allah is Aware of all things. 
29|63|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And if thou wert to ask them: Who causeth water to come down from the  sky, and therewith reviveth the earth after its death ? they verily would say: Allah.  Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them have no sense. 
29|64|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|This life of the world is but a pastime and a game. Lo! the home of the  Hereafter - that is Life, if they but knew. 
29|65|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|And when they mount upon the ships they pray to Allah, making their faith  pure for Him only, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe  partners (unto Him), 
29|66|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|That they may disbelieve in that which We have given them, and that they  may take their ease. But they will come to know. 
29|67|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Have they not seen that We have appointed a sanctuary immune (from  violence), while mankind are ravaged all around them ? Do they then believe in  falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of Allah ? 
29|68|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah, or  denieth the truth when it cometh unto him ? Is not there a home in hell for  disbelievers ? 
29|69|al-`Ankabut: The Spider|As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and lo!  Allah is with the good. 
30|1|ar-Rum: The Romans|Alif. Lam. Mim. 
30|2|ar-Rum: The Romans|The Romans have been defeated 
30|3|ar-Rum: The Romans|In the nearer land, and they, after their defeat will be victorious 
30|4|ar-Rum: The Romans|Within ten years - Allah's is the command in the former case and in the latter  - and in that day believers will rejoice 
30|5|ar-Rum: The Romans|In Allah's help to victory. He helpeth to victory whom He will. He is the  Mighty, the Merciful. 
30|6|ar-Rum: The Romans|It is a promise of Allah. Allah faileth not His promise, but most of mankind  know not. 
30|7|ar-Rum: The Romans|They know only some appearance of the life of the world, and are heedless  of the Hereafter. 
30|8|ar-Rum: The Romans|Have they not pondered upon themselves ? Allah created not the heavens and  the earth, and that which is between them, save with truth and for a destined end. But  truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord. 
30|9|ar-Rum: The Romans|Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence  for those who were before them ? They were stronger than these in power, and they  dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built. Messengers of their own  came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty). Surely Allah wronged  them not, but they did wrong themselves. 
30|10|ar-Rum: The Romans|Then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil, because they  denied the revelations of Allah and made a mock of them. 
30|11|ar-Rum: The Romans|Allah produceth creation, then He reproduceth it, then unto Him ye will be  returned. 
30|12|ar-Rum: The Romans|And in the day when the Hour riseth the unrighteous will despair. 
30|13|ar-Rum: The Romans|There will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal  with Allah. And they will reject their partners (whom they ascribed unto Him). 
30|14|ar-Rum: The Romans|In the day when the Hour cometh, in that day they will be sundered. 
30|15|ar-Rum: The Romans|As for those who believed and did good works, they will be made happy in a  Garden. 
30|16|ar-Rum: The Romans|But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, and denied the  meeting of the Hereafter, such will be brought to doom. 
30|17|ar-Rum: The Romans|So glory be to Allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning - 
30|18|ar-Rum: The Romans|Unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth! - and at the sun's decline  and in the noonday. 
30|19|ar-Rum: The Romans|He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead  from the living, and He reviveth the earth after her death. And even so will ye be  brought forth. 
30|20|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is this: He created you of dust, and behold you human  beings, ranging widely! 
30|21|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is this: He created for you helpmeets from yourselves that  ye might find rest in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo! herein  indeed are portents for folk who reflect. 
30|22|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the  difference of your languages and colours. Lo! herein indeed are portents for men of  knowledge. 
30|23|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is your slumber by night and by day, and your seeking of  His bounty. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who heed. 
30|24|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is this: He showeth you the lightning for a fear and for a  hope, and sendeth down water from the sky, and thereby quickeneth the earth after  her death. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who understand. 
30|25|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is this: The heavens and the earth stand fast by His  command, and afterward, when He calleth you, lo! from the earth ye will emerge. 
30|26|ar-Rum: The Romans|Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are  obedient unto Him. 
30|27|ar-Rum: The Romans|He it is Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and it is easier for Him.  His is the Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth. He is the Mighty, the  Wise. 
30|28|ar-Rum: The Romans|He coineth for you a similitude of yourselves. Have ye, from among those  whom your right hands possess, partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you,  equal with you in respect thereof, so that ye fear them as ye fear each other (that ye  ascribe unto Us partners out of that which We created) ? Thus We display the  revelations for people who have sense. 
30|29|ar-Rum: The Romans|Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge.  Who is able to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray ? For such there are no  helpers. 
30|30|ar-Rum: The Romans|So set thy purpose (O Muhammad) for religion as a man by nature upright -  the nature (framed) of Allah, in which He hath created man. There is no altering (the  laws of) Allah's creation. That is the right religion, but most men know not - 
30|31|ar-Rum: The Romans|Turning unto Him (only); and be careful of your duty unto Him and establish  worship, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him); 
30|32|ar-Rum: The Romans|Of those who split up their religion and became schismatics, each sect  exulting in its tenets. 
30|33|ar-Rum: The Romans|And when harm toucheth men they cry unto their Lord, turning to Him in  repentance; then, when they have tasted of His mercy, behold! some of them attribute  partners to their Lord 
30|34|ar-Rum: The Romans|So as to disbelieve in that which We have given them. (Unto such it is said):  Enjoy yourselves awhile, but ye will come to know. 
30|35|ar-Rum: The Romans|Or have We revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which  they associate with Him ? 
30|36|ar-Rum: The Romans|And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein; but if an  evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds, lo! they are in despair! 
30|37|ar-Rum: The Romans|See they not that Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and  straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who believe. 
30|38|ar-Rum: The Romans|So give to the kinsman his due, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer. That is  best for those who seek Allah's Countenance. And such are they who are successful. 
30|39|ar-Rum: The Romans|That which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on (other) people's  property hath no increase with Allah; but that which ye give in charity, seeking  Allah's Countenance, hath increase manifold. 
30|40|ar-Rum: The Romans|Allah is He Who created you and then sustained you, then causeth you to die,  then giveth life to you again. Is there any of your (so-called) partners (of Allah) that  doeth aught of that ? Praised and Exalted be He above what they associate (with  Him)! 
30|41|ar-Rum: The Romans|Corruption doth appear on land and sea because of (the evil) which men's  hands have done, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in  order that they may return. 
30|42|ar-Rum: The Romans|Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): Travel in the land, and see the  nature of the consequence for those who were before you! Most of them were  idolaters. 
30|43|ar-Rum: The Romans|So set thy purpose resolutely for the right religion, before the inevitable day  cometh from Allah. On that day mankind will be sundered- 
30|44|ar-Rum: The Romans|Whoso disbelieveth must (then) bear the consequences of his disbelief, while  those who do right make provision for themselves - 
30|45|ar-Rum: The Romans|That He may reward out of His bounty those who believe and do good  works. Lo! He loveth not the disbelievers (in His guidance). 
30|46|ar-Rum: The Romans|And of His signs is this: He sendeth herald winds to make you taste His  mercy, and that the ships may sail at His command, and that ye may seek his favour,  and that haply ye may be thankful. 
30|47|ar-Rum: The Romans|Verily We sent before thee (Muhammad) messengers to their own folk. Then  we took vengeance upon those who were guilty (in regard to them). To help believers  is ever incumbent upon Us. 
30|48|ar-Rum: The Romans|Allah is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds, and spreadeth  them along the sky as pleaseth Him, and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain  downpouring from within them. And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will of  His bondmen, lo! they rejoice; 
30|49|ar-Rum: The Romans|Though before that, even before it was sent down upon them, they were in  despair. 
30|50|ar-Rum: The Romans|Look, therefore, at the prints of Allah's mercy (in creation): how He  quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! He verily is the Quickener of the Dead, and  He is Able to do all things. 
30|51|ar-Rum: The Romans|And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow, they verily would still  continue in their disbelief. 
30|52|ar-Rum: The Romans|For verily thou (Muhammad) canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou  make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee. 
30|53|ar-Rum: The Romans|Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to  hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender (unto Him). 
30|54|ar-Rum: The Romans|Allah is He Who shaped you out of weakness, then appointed after weakness  strength, then, after strength, appointed weakness and grey hair. He createth what He  will. He is the Knower, the Mighty. 
30|55|ar-Rum: The Romans|And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry  but an hour - thus were they ever deceived. 
30|56|ar-Rum: The Romans|But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say: The truth is, ye  have tarried, by Allah's decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of  Resurrection, but ye used not to know. 
30|57|ar-Rum: The Romans|In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice, nor will they  be allowed to make amends. 
30|58|ar-Rum: The Romans|Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of similitudes;  and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle, those who disbelieve would  verily exclaim: Ye are but tricksters! 
30|59|ar-Rum: The Romans|Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not. 
30|60|ar-Rum: The Romans|So have patience (O Muhammad)! Allah's promise is the very truth, and let  not those who have no certainty make thee impatient. 
31|1|Luqman: Lukman|Alif. Lam. Mim. 
31|2|Luqman: Lukman|These are revelations of the wise Scripture, 
31|3|Luqman: Lukman|A guidance and a mercy for the good, 
31|4|Luqman: Lukman|Those who establish worship and pay the poor-due and have sure faith in the  Hereafter. 
31|5|Luqman: Lukman|Such have guidance from their Lord. Such are the successful. 
31|6|Luqman: Lukman|And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may  mislead from Allah's way without knowledge, and maketh it the butt of mockery. For  such there is a shameful doom. 
31|7|Luqman: Lukman|And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if  he heard them not, as if there were a deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a  painful doom. 
31|8|Luqman: Lukman|Lo! those who believe and do good works, for them are the gardens of  delight, 
31|9|Luqman: Lukman|Wherein they will abide. It is a promise of Allah in truth. He is the Mighty,  the Wise. 
31|10|Luqman: Lukman|He hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see, and hath cast  into the earth firm hills, so that it quake not with you; and He hath dispersed therein  all kinds of beasts. And We send down water from the sky and We cause (plants) of  every goodly kind to grow therein. 
31|11|Luqman: Lukman|This is the Creation of Allah. Now show me that which those (ye worship)  beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest! 
31|12|Luqman: Lukman|And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, saying: Give thanks unto Allah; and  whosoever giveth thanks, he giveth thanks for (the good of) his soul. And whosoever  refuseth - Lo! Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
31|13|Luqman: Lukman|And (remember) when Luqman said unto his son, when he was exhorting  him: O my dear son! Ascribe no partners unto Allah. Lo! to ascribe partners (unto  Him) is a tremendous wrong - 
31|14|Luqman: Lukman|And We have enjoined upon man concerning his partners - His mother  beareth him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years - Give  thanks unto Me and unto thy parents. Unto Me is the journeying. 
31|15|Luqman: Lukman|But if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto Me as partner that of  which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world  kindly, and follow the path of him who repenteth unto Me. Then unto Me will be your  return, and I shall tell you what ye used to do - 
31|16|Luqman: Lukman|O my dear son! Lo! though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed,  and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth.  Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware. 
31|17|Luqman: Lukman|O my dear son! Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity,  and persevere whatever may befall thee. Lo! that is of the steadfast heart of things. 
31|18|Luqman: Lukman|Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the land.  Lo! Allah loveth not each braggart boaster. 
31|19|Luqman: Lukman|Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice. Lo! the harshest of all voices  is the voice of the ass. 
31|20|Luqman: Lukman|See ye not how Allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the  skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with His favours both  without and within ? Yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah, without  knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light. 
31|21|Luqman: Lukman|And if it be said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they say:  Nay, but we follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though the devil  were inviting them unto the doom of flame ? 
31|22|Luqman: Lukman|Whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, he verily  hath grasped the firm hand-hold. Unto Allah belongeth the sequel of all things. 
31|23|Luqman: Lukman|And whosoever disbelieveth, let not his disbelief afflict thee (O  Muhammad). Unto Us is their return, and We shall tell them what they did. Lo! Allah  is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men). 
31|24|Luqman: Lukman|We give them comfort for a little, and then We drive them to a heavy doom. 
31|25|Luqman: Lukman|If thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth ? they  would answer: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not. 
31|26|Luqman: Lukman|Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Lo! Allah,  He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. 
31|27|Luqman: Lukman|And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea, with seven more seas  to help it, (were ink), the words of Allah could not be exhausted. Lo! Allah is Mighty,  Wise. 
31|28|Luqman: Lukman|Your creation and your raising (from the dead) are only as (the creation and  the raising of) a single soul. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
31|29|Luqman: Lukman|Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and  causeth the day to pass into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the moon (to do  their work), each running unto an appointed term; and that Allah is Informed of what  ye do ? 
31|30|Luqman: Lukman|That (is so) because Allah, He is the True, and that which they invoke beside  Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the Sublime, the Great. 
31|31|Luqman: Lukman|Hast thou not seen how the ships glide on the sea by Allah's grace, that He  may show you of His wonders ? Lo! therein indeed are portents for every steadfast,  grateful (heart). 
31|32|Luqman: Lukman|And if a wave enshroudeth them like awnings, they cry unto Allah, making  their faith pure for Him only. But when He bringeth them safe to land, some of them  compromise. None denieth Our signs save every traitor ingrate. 
31|33|Luqman: Lukman|O mankind! Keep your duty to your Lord and fear a Day when the parent  will not be able to avail the child in aught, nor the child to avail the parent. Lo!  Allah's promise is the very truth. Let not the life of the world beguile you, nor let the  deceiver beguile you, in regard to Allah. 
31|34|Luqman: Lukman|Lo! Allah! With Him is knowledge of the Hour. He sendeth down the rain,  and knoweth that which is in the wombs. No soul knoweth what it will earn to- morrow, and no soul knoweth in what land it will die. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware. 
32|1|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Alif. Lam. Mim 
32|2|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|The revelation of the Scripture whereof there is no doubt is from the Lord of  the Worlds. 
32|3|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Or say they: He hath invented it ? Nay, but it is the Truth from thy Lord, that  thou mayst warn a folk to whom no warner came before thee, that haply they may  walk aright. 
32|4|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between  them, in six Days. Then He mounted the Throne. Ye have not, beside Him, a  protecting friend or mediator. Will ye not then remember ? 
32|5|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|He directeth the ordinance from the heaven unto the earth; then it ascendeth  unto Him in a Day, whereof the measure is a thousand years of that ye reckon. 
32|6|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Such is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the  Merciful, 
32|7|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Who made all things good which He created, and He began the creation of  man from clay; 
32|8|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Then He made his seed from a draught of despised fluid; 
32|9|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His Spirit; and appointed  for you hearing and sight and hearts. Small thanks give ye! 
32|10|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And they say: When we are lost in the earth, how can we then be re-created ?  Nay but they are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord. 
32|11|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Say: The angel of death, who hath charge concerning you, will gather you,  and afterward unto your Lord ye will be returned. 
32|12|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Couldst thou but see when the guilty hang their heads before their Lord, (and  say): Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back; we will do right, now  we are sure. 
32|13|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And if We had so willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but  the word from Me concerning evildoers took effect: that I will fill hell with the jinn  and mankind together. 
32|14|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|So taste (the evil of your deeds). Forasmuch as ye forgot the meeting of this  your day, lo! We forget you. Taste the doom of immortality because of what ye used  to do. 
32|15|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Only those believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded of them,  fall down prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord, and they are not scornful, 
32|16|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of  that We have bestowed on them. 
32|17|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward for what they  used to do. 
32|18|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver ? They are not alike. 
32|19|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|But as for those who believe and do good works, for them are the Gardens of  Retreat - a welcome (in reward) for what they used to do. 
32|20|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And as for those who do evil, their retreat is the Fire. Whenever they desire  to issue forth from thence, they are brought back thither. Unto them it is said: Taste  the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny. 
32|21|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And verily We make them taste the lower punishment before the greater, that  haply they may return. 
32|22|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of  his Lord, then turneth from them. Lo! We shall requite the guilty. 
32|23|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|We verily gave Moses the Scripture; so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it;  and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel. 
32|24|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And when they became steadfast and believed firmly in Our revelations, We  appointed from among them leaders who guided by Our command. 
32|25|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection  concerning that wherein they used to differ. 
32|26|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Is it not a guidance for them (to observe) how many generations We  destroyed before them, amid whose dwelling places they do walk ? Lo! therein verily  are portents! Will they not then heed ? 
32|27|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Have they not seen how We lead the water to the barren land and therewith  bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat, and they themselves ? Will they not then see  ? 
32|28|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|And they say: When cometh this victory (of yours) if ye are truthful ? 
32|29|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|Say (unto them): On the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve  (and who then will believe) will not avail them, neither will they be reprieved. 
32|30|as-Sajdah: The Adoration|So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), and await (the event). Lo! they  (also) are awaiting (it). 
33|1|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah and obey not the disbelievers and the  hypocrites. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. 
33|2|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord. Lo! Allah is Aware  of what ye do. 
33|3|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And put thy trust in Allah, for Allah is sufficient as Trustee. 
33|4|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body, nor hath  He made your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers) your mothers, nor hath He  made those whom ye claim (to be your sons) your sons. This is but a saying of your  mouths. But Allah saith the truth and He showeth the way. 
33|5|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Proclaim their real parentage. That will be more equitable in the sight of  Allah. And if ye know not their fathers, then (they are) your brethren in the faith, and  your clients. And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye make unintentionally,  but what your hearts purpose (that will be a sin for you). Allah is ever Forgiving,  Merciful. 
33|6|al-Ahzab: The Allies|The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as)  their mothers. And the owners of kinship are closer one to another in the ordinance of  Allah than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca), except that ye  should do kindness to your friends. This is written in the Book (of nature). 
33|7|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And when We exacted a covenant from the prophets, and from thee (O  Muhammad) and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary. We  took from them a solemn covenant; 
33|8|al-Ahzab: The Allies|That He may ask the loyal of their loyalty. And He hath prepared a painful  doom for the unfaithful. 
33|9|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye who believe! Remember Allah's favour unto you when there came  against you hosts, and We sent against them a great wind and hosts ye could not see.  And Allah is ever Seer of what ye do. 
33|10|al-Ahzab: The Allies|When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when  eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats, and ye were imagining vain thoughts  concerning Allah. 
33|11|al-Ahzab: The Allies|There were the believers sorely tried, and shaken with a mighty shock. 
33|12|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were  saying: Allah and His messenger promised us naught but delusion. 
33|13|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And when a party of them said: O folk of Yathrib! There is no stand  (possible) for you, therefor turn back. And certain of them (even) sought permission  of the Prophet, saying: Our homes lie open (to the enemy). And they lay not open.  They but wished to flee. 
33|14|al-Ahzab: The Allies|If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to  treachery, they would have committed it, and would have hesitated thereupon but  little. 
33|15|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And verily they had already sworn unto Allah that they would not turn their  backs (to the foe). An oath to Allah must be answered for. 
33|16|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Say: Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing, and then ye  dwell in comfort but a little while. 
33|17|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Say: Who is he who can preserve you from Allah if He intendeth harm for  you, or intendeth mercy for you. They will not find that they have any friend or helper  other than Allah. 
33|18|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Allah already knoweth those of you who hinder, and those who say unto  their brethren: "Come ye hither unto us!" and they come not to the stress of battle  save a little, 
33|19|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Being sparing of their help to you (believers). But when the fear cometh,  then thou (Muhammad) seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who  fainteth unto death. Then, when the fear departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues  in their greed for wealth (from the spoil). Such have not believed. Therefor Allah  maketh their deeds fruitless. And that is easy for Allah. 
33|20|al-Ahzab: The Allies|They hold that the clans have not retired (for good); and if the clans should  advance (again), they would fain be in the desert with the wandering Arabs, asking  for the news of you; and if they were among you, they would not give battle, save a  little. 
33|21|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example for him who  looketh unto Allah and the Last Day, and remembereth Allah much. 
33|22|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And when the true believers saw the clans, they said: This is that which  Allah and His messenger promised us. Allah and His messenger are true. It did but  confirm them in their faith and resignation. 
33|23|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with  Allah. Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still  are waiting; and they have not altered in the least; 
33|24|al-Ahzab: The Allies|That Allah may reward the true men for their truth, and punish the hypocrites  if He will, or relent toward them (if He will). Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
33|25|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And Allah repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath; they gained no good.  Allah averted their attack from the believers. Allah is ever Strong, Mighty. 
33|26|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them  down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye  made captive some. 
33|27|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth,  and land ye have not trodden. Allah is ever Able to do all things. 
33|28|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Prophet! Say unto thy wives: If ye desire the world's life and its  adornment, come! I will content you and will release you with a fair release. 
33|29|al-Ahzab: The Allies|But if ye desire Allah and His messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then  lo! Allah hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward. 
33|30|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye wives of the Prophet! Whosoever of you committeth manifest  lewdness, the punishment for her will be doubled, and that is easy for Allah. 
33|31|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And whosoever of you is submissive unto Allah and His messenger and  doeth right, We shall give her her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a  rich provision. 
33|32|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your  duty (to Allah), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire  (to you), but utter customary speech. 
33|33|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the  Time of Ignorance. Be regular in prayer, and pay the poor-due, and obey Allah and  His messenger. Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Folk of the  Household, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing. 
33|34|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And bear in mind that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of  Allah and wisdom. Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware. 
33|35|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Lo! men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender, and men who  believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men  who speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere (in  righteousness) and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who  are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast  and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard (their  modesty), and men who remember Allah much and women who remember - Allah  hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward. 
33|36|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and  His messenger have decided an affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim  any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily  goeth astray in error manifest. 
33|37|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour and  thou hast conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear Allah. And thou didst  hide in thy mind that which Allah was to bring to light, and thou didst fear mankind  whereas Allah hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. So when Zeyd had  performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in  marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of  their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of  release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled. 
33|38|al-Ahzab: The Allies|There is no reproach for the Prophet in that which Allah maketh his due.  That was Allah's way with those who passed away of old - and the commandment of  Allah is certain destiny - 
33|39|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Who delivered the messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none save  Allah. Allah keepeth good account. 
33|40|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger  of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah is ever Aware of all things. 
33|41|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance. 
33|42|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And glorify Him early and late. 
33|43|al-Ahzab: The Allies|He it is Who blesseth you, and His angels (bless you), that He may bring you  forth from darkness unto light; and He is ever Merciful to the believers. 
33|44|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Their salutation on the day when they shall meet Him will be: Peace. And He  hath prepared for them a goodly recompense. 
33|45|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings  and a warner. 
33|46|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth  light. 
33|47|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great  bounty from Allah. 
33|48|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their  noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee. 
33|49|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye who believe! If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye  have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon. But content them  and release them handsomely. 
33|50|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Prophet! Lo! We have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou  hast paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom  Allah hath given thee as spoils of war, and the daughters of thine uncle on the father's  side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father's side, and the daughters of thine  uncle on the mother's side and the daughters of thine aunts on the mother's side who  emigrated with thee, and a believing woman if she give herself unto the Prophet and  the Prophet desire to ask her in marriage - a privilege for thee only, not for the (rest  of) believers - We are Aware of that which We enjoined upon them concerning their  wives and those whom their right hands possess - that thou mayst be free from blame,  for Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
33|51|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them and receive unto thee whom thou  wilt, and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set aside (temporarily),  it is no sin for thee (to receive her again); that is better; that they may be comforted  and not grieve, and may all be pleased with what thou givest them. Allah knoweth  what is in your hearts (O men), and Allah is ever Forgiving, Clement. 
33|52|al-Ahzab: The Allies|It is not allowed thee to take (other) women henceforth, nor that thou  shouldst change them for other wives even though their beauty pleased thee, save  those whom thy right hand possesseth. And Allah is ever Watcher over all things. 
33|53|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal without  waiting for the proper time, unless permission be granted you. But if ye are invited,  enter, and, when your meal is ended, then disperse. Linger not for conversation. Lo!  that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy of (asking) you (to  go); but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them (the wives of the  Prophet) anything, ask it of them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts  and for their hearts. And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of  Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him. Lo! that in Allah's sight  would be an enormity. 
33|54|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Whether ye divulge a thing or keep it hidden, lo! Allah is ever Knower of all  things. 
33|55|al-Ahzab: The Allies|It is no sin for them (thy wives) to converse freely) with their fathers, or their  sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or the sons of their sisters or of their  own women, or their slaves. O women! Keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is ever  Witness over all things. 
33|56|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who  believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation. 
33|57|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Lo! those who malign Allah and His messenger, Allah hath cursed them in  the world and the Hereafter, and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained. 
33|58|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And those who malign believing men and believing women undeservedly,  they bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin. 
33|59|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers  to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so  that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
33|60|al-Ahzab: The Allies|If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in  the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be  your neighbours in it but a little while. 
33|61|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce)  slaughter. 
33|62|al-Ahzab: The Allies|That was the way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of old; thou  wilt not find for the way of Allah aught of power to change. 
33|63|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Men ask thee of the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is with Allah only. What  can convey (the knowledge) unto thee ? It may be that the Hour is nigh. 
33|64|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Lo! Allah hath cursed the disbelievers, and hath prepared for them a flaming  fire, 
33|65|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Wherein they will abide for ever. They will find (then) no protecting friend  nor helper. 
33|66|al-Ahzab: The Allies|On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they say: Oh, would  that we had obeyed Allah and had obeyed His messenger! 
33|67|al-Ahzab: The Allies|And they say: Our Lord! Lo! we obeyed our princes and great men, and they  misled us from the Way. 
33|68|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Our Lord! Oh, give them double torment and curse them with a mighty  curse. 
33|69|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye who believe! Be not as those who slandered Moses, but Allah proved  his innocence of that which they alleged, and he was well esteemed in Allah's sight. 
33|70|al-Ahzab: The Allies|O ye who believe! Guard your duty to Allah, and speak words straight to the  point; 
33|71|al-Ahzab: The Allies|He will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins. Whosoever  obeyeth Allah and His messenger, he verily hath gained a signal victory. 
33|72|al-Ahzab: The Allies|Lo! We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills, but they  shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it. And man assumed it. Lo! he hath proved  a tyrant and a fool. 
33|73|al-Ahzab: The Allies|So Allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women, and idolatrous  men and idolatrous women. But Allah pardoneth believing men and believing  women, and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
34|1|Saba': Sheba|Praise be to Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. His is the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the  Aware. 
34|2|Saba': Sheba|He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from  it, and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it. He is the  Merciful, the Forgiving. 
34|3|Saba': Sheba|Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay, by  my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the Knower of the Unseen. Not an  atom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth,  but it is in a clear Record, 
34|4|Saba': Sheba|That He may reward those who believe and do good works. For them is  pardon and a rich provision. 
34|5|Saba': Sheba|But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be  a painful doom of wrath. 
34|6|Saba': Sheba|Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee  from thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of  Praise. 
34|7|Saba': Sheba|Those who disbelieve say: Shall we show you a man who will tell you (that)  when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still, even then,  ye will be created anew ? 
34|8|Saba': Sheba|Hath he invented a lie concerning Allah, or is there in him a madness ? Nay,  but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error. 
34|9|Saba': Sheba|Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the  sky and the earth ? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause  obliteration from the sky to fall on them.  Lo! herein surely is a portent for every  slave who turneth (to Allah) repentant. 
34|10|Saba': Sheba|And assuredly We gave David grace from Us, (saying): O ye hills and birds,  echo his psalms of praise! And We made the iron supple unto him, 
34|11|Saba': Sheba|Saying: Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links (thereof). And  do ye right. Lo! I am Seer of what ye do. 
34|12|Saba': Sheba|And unto Solomon (We gave) the wind, whereof the morning course was a  month's journey and the evening course a month's journey, and We caused the fount  of copper to gush forth for him, and (We gave him) certain of the jinn who worked  before him by permission of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our  command, them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming Fire. 
34|13|Saba': Sheba|They made for him what he willed: synagogues and statues, basins like wells  and boilers built into the ground. Give thanks, O House of David! Few of My  bondmen are thankful. 
34|14|Saba': Sheba|And when We decreed death for him, nothing showed his death to them save  a creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff. And when he fell the  jinn saw clearly how, if they had known the Unseen, they would not have continued  in despised toil. 
34|15|Saba': Sheba|There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on  the right hand and the left (as who should say): Eat of the provision of your Lord and  render thanks to Him. A fair land and an indulgent Lord! 
34|16|Saba': Sheba|But they were froward, so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram, and in  exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the  tamarisk and here and there a lote-tree. 
34|17|Saba': Sheba|This We awarded them because of their ingratitude. Punish We ever any save  the ingrates ? 
34|18|Saba': Sheba|And We set, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy  to be seen, and We made the stage between them easy, (saying): Travel in them safely  both by night and day. 
34|19|Saba': Sheba|But they said: Our Lord! Make the stage between our journeys longer. And  they wronged themselves, therefore We made them bywords (in the land) and  scattered them abroad, a total scattering. Lo! herein verily are portents for each  steadfast, grateful (heart). 
34|20|Saba': Sheba|And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow  him, all save a group of true believers. 
34|21|Saba': Sheba|And he had no warrant whatsoever against them, save that We would know  him who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof; and thy Lord (O  Muhammad) taketh note of all things. 
34|22|Saba': Sheba|Say (O Muhammad): Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah! They  possess not an atom's weight either in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any  share in either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them. 
34|23|Saba': Sheba|No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth. Yet,  when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: What was it that your Lord said ?  They say: The Truth. And He is the Sublime, the Great. 
34|24|Saba': Sheba|Say: Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth ? Say: Allah, Lo!  we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest. 
34|25|Saba': Sheba|Say: Ye will not be asked of what we committed, nor shall we be asked of  what ye do. 
34|26|Saba': Sheba|Say: Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will judge between us with  truth. He is the All-knowing Judge. 
34|27|Saba': Sheba|Say: Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners. Nay (ye  dare not)! For He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. 
34|28|Saba': Sheba|And We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) save as a bringer of good tidings  and a warner unto all mankind; but most of mankind know not. 
34|29|Saba': Sheba|And they say: When is this promise (to be fulfilled) if ye are truthful ? 
34|30|Saba': Sheba|Say (O Muhammad): Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot  postpone nor hasten by an hour. 
34|31|Saba': Sheba|And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that  which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are brought up  before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were  despised (in the earth) say unto those who were proud: But for you, we should have  been believers. 
34|32|Saba': Sheba|Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you  away from the guidance after it had come unto you ? Nay, but ye were guilty. 
34|33|Saba': Sheba|Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but (it was  your) scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set  up rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and  We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught save  what they used to do ? 
34|34|Saba': Sheba|And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones  declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent. 
34|35|Saba': Sheba|And they say: We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the  punished! 
34|36|Saba': Sheba|Say (O Muhammad): Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will  and narroweth it (for whom He will). But most of mankind know not. 
34|37|Saba': Sheba|And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us,  but he who believeth and doeth good (he draweth near). As for such, theirs will be  twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls. 
34|38|Saba': Sheba|And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will be  brought to the doom. 
34|39|Saba': Sheba|Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen,  and narroweth (it) for him. And whatsoever ye spend (for good) He replaceth it. And  He is the Best of Providers. 
34|40|Saba': Sheba|And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the  angels: Did these worship you ? 
34|41|Saba': Sheba|They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them!  Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them. 
34|42|Saba': Sheba|That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say  unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny. 
34|43|Saba': Sheba|And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is  naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to  worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve  say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic. 
34|44|Saba': Sheba|And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto  them, before thee, any warner. 
34|45|Saba': Sheba|Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which  We bestowed on them (of old); yet they denied My messengers. How intense then  was My abhorrence (of them)! 
34|46|Saba': Sheba|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye  awake, for Allah's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no madness in  your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom. 
34|47|Saba': Sheba|Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the  affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things. 
34|48|Saba': Sheba|Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. (He is) the Knower of Things Hidden. 
34|49|Saba': Sheba|Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not  return. 
34|50|Saba': Sheba|Say: If I err, I err only to my own loss, and if I am rightly guided it is  because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me. Lo! He is Hearer, Nigh. 
34|51|Saba': Sheba|Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape, and are seized  from near at hand, 
34|52|Saba': Sheba|And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar  off, 
34|53|Saba': Sheba|When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off. 
34|54|Saba': Sheba|And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for  people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt. 
35|1|al-Fatir: The Creator|Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who appointeth  the angels messengers having wings two, three and four. He multiplieth in creation  what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 
35|2|al-Fatir: The Creator|That which Allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it; and  that which He withholdeth none can release thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise. 
35|3|al-Fatir: The Creator|O mankind! Remember Allah's grace toward you! Is there any creator other  than Allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth ? There is no God save  Him. Whither then are ye turned ? 
35|4|al-Fatir: The Creator|And if they deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of Allah) were denied  before thee. Unto Allah all things are brought back. 
35|5|al-Fatir: The Creator|O mankind! Lo! the promise of Allah is true. So let not the life of the world  beguile you, and let not the (avowed) beguiler beguile you with regard to Allah. 
35|6|al-Fatir: The Creator|Lo! the devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only  summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire. 
35|7|al-Fatir: The Creator|Those who disbelieve, theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe  and do good works, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward. 
35|8|al-Fatir: The Creator|Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he  deemeth it good, (other than Satan's dupe) ? Allah verily sendeth whom He will  astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them. Lo!  Allah is Aware of what they do! 
35|9|al-Fatir: The Creator|And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead  it unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such is the  Resurrection. 
35|10|al-Fatir: The Creator|Whoso desireth power (should know that) all power belongeth to Allah. Unto  Him good words ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt; but those who plot  iniquities, theirs will be an awful doom; and the plotting of such (folk) will come to  naught. 
35|11|al-Fatir: The Creator|Allah created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you pairs  (the male and female). No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge.  And no-one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is  recorded in a Book, Lo! that is easy for Allah. 
35|12|al-Fatir: The Creator|And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this (other)  bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye  wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His  bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks. 
35|13|al-Fatir: The Creator|He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into  the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an  appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto  whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone. 
35|14|al-Fatir: The Creator|If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could  not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you.  None can inform you like Him Who is Aware. 
35|15|al-Fatir: The Creator|O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah. And Allah! He is the  Absolute, the Owner of Praise. 
35|16|al-Fatir: The Creator|If He will, He can be rid of you and bring (instead of you) some new  creation. 
35|17|al-Fatir: The Creator|That is not a hard thing for Allah. 
35|18|al-Fatir: The Creator|And no burdened soul can bear another's burden, and if one heavy laden  crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom  he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have  established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he  cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto Allah is the journeying. 
35|19|al-Fatir: The Creator|The blind man is not equal with the seer; 
35|20|al-Fatir: The Creator|Nor is darkness (tantamount to) light; 
35|21|al-Fatir: The Creator|Nor is the shadow equal with the sun's full heat; 
35|22|al-Fatir: The Creator|Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! Allah maketh whom He will to  hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves. 
35|23|al-Fatir: The Creator|Thou art but a warner. 
35|24|al-Fatir: The Creator|Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner;  and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them. 
35|25|al-Fatir: The Creator|And if they deny thee, those before them also denied. Their messengers came  unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), and with the Psalms and the  Scripture giving light. 
35|26|al-Fatir: The Creator|Then seized I those who disbelieved, and how intense was My abhorrence! 
35|27|al-Fatir: The Creator|Hast thou not seen that Allah causeth water to fall from the sky, and We  produce therewith fruit of divers hues; and among the hills are streaks white and red,  of divers hues, and (others) raven-black; 
35|28|al-Fatir: The Creator|And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues ? The erudite  among His bondmen fear Allah alone. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Forgiving. 
35|29|al-Fatir: The Creator|Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah, and establish worship, and spend  of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to  imperishable gain, 
35|30|al-Fatir: The Creator|That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace. Lo! He is  Forgiving, Responsive. 
35|31|al-Fatir: The Creator|As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture, it is the Truth  confirming that which was (revealed) before it. Lo! Allah is indeed Observer, Seer of  His slaves. 
35|32|al-Fatir: The Creator|Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of  Our bondmen. But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some  who are lukewarm, and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds,  by Allah's leave. That is the great favour! 
35|33|al-Fatir: The Creator|Gardens of Eden! They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and  their raiment therein is silk. 
35|34|al-Fatir: The Creator|And they say: Praise be to Allah Who hath put grief away from us. Lo! Our  Lord is Forgiving, Bountiful, 
35|35|al-Fatir: The Creator|Who, of His grace, hath installed us in the mansion of eternity, where toil  toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us. 
35|36|al-Fatir: The Creator|But as for those who disbelieve, for them is fire of hell; it taketh not  complete effect upon them so that they can die, nor is its torment lightened for them.  Thus We punish every ingrate. 
35|37|al-Fatir: The Creator|And they cry for help there, (saying): Our Lord! Release us; we will do right,  not (the wrong) that we used to do. Did not We grant you a life long enough for him  who reflected to reflect therein ? And the warner came unto you. Now taste (the  flavour of your deeds), for evil-doers have no helper. 
35|38|al-Fatir: The Creator|Lo! Allah is the Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Lo! He  is Aware of the secret of (men's) breasts. 
35|39|al-Fatir: The Creator|He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth; so he who disbelieveth, his  disbelief be on his own head. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers, in their  Lord's sight, naught save abhorrence. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers  naught save loss. 
35|40|al-Fatir: The Creator|Say: Have ye seen your partner-gods to whom ye pray beside Allah ? Show  me what they created of the earth! Or have they any portion in the heavens ? Or have  We given them a scripture so they act on clear proof therefrom ? Nay, the evil-doers  promise one another only to deceive. 
35|41|al-Fatir: The Creator|Lo! Allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not, and if  they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Lo! He is ever  Clement, Forgiving. 
35|42|al-Fatir: The Creator|And they swore by Allah, their most binding oath, that if a warner came unto  them they would be more tractable than any of the nations; yet, when a warner came  unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance, 
35|43|al-Fatir: The Creator|(Shown in their) behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil; and the  evil plot encloseth but the men who make it. Then, can they expect aught save the  treatment of the folk of old ? Thou wilt not find for Allah's way of treatment any  substitute, nor wilt thou find for Allah's way of treatment aught of power to change. 
35|44|al-Fatir: The Creator|Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence  for those who were before them, and they were mightier than these in power ? Allah  is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him. Lo! He is the Wise,  the Mighty. 
35|45|al-Fatir: The Creator|If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not  leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an  appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) Allah  is ever Seer of His slaves. 
36|1|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Ya Sin. 
36|2|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|By the wise Qur'an, 
36|3|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Lo! thou art of those sent 
36|4|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|On a straight path, 
36|5|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, 
36|6|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are  heedless. 
36|7|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them,  for they believe not. 
36|8|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they  are made stiff-necked. 
36|9|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have  covered them so that they see not. 
36|10|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they  believe not. 
36|11|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the  Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. 
36|12|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send  before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. 
36|13|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from  Allah) came unto them; 
36|14|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We  reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. 
36|15|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught  revealed. Ye do but lie! 
36|16|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, 
36|17|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). 
36|18|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|(The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall  surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. 
36|19|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of  the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! 
36|20|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:  O my people! Follow those who have been sent! 
36|21|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. 
36|22|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto  Whom ye will be brought back ? 
36|23|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish  me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? 
36|24|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Then truly I should be in error manifest. 
36|25|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! 
36|26|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew 
36|27|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the  honoured ones! 
36|28|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do  We ever send. 
36|29|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. 
36|30|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger  but they did mock him! 
36|31|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which  indeed returned not unto them; 
36|32|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. 
36|33|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it  grain so that they eat thereof; 
36|34|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We  have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, 
36|35|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they  not, then, give thanks ? 
36|36|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth  groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! 
36|37|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in  darkness. 
36|38|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of  the Mighty, the Wise. 
36|39|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old  shrivelled palm-leaf. 
36|40|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day.  They float each in an orbit. 
36|41|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, 
36|42|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. 
36|43|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can  they be saved; 
36|44|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. 
36|45|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which  is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). 
36|46|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn  away from it! 
36|47|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided  you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom  Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. 
36|48|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? 
36|49|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. 
36|50|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. 
36|51|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, 
36|52|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is  that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. 
36|53|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! 
36|54|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye  used to do. 
36|55|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, 
36|56|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; 
36|57|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; 
36|58|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! 
36|59|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! 
36|60|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!  he is your open foe! - 
36|61|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. 
36|62|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? 
36|63|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). 
36|64|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. 
36|65|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their  feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. 
36|66|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that  they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? 
36|67|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making  them powerless to go forward or turn back. 
36|68|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go  back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? 
36|69|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him.  This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, 
36|70|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the  disbelievers. 
36|71|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the  cattle, so that they are their owners, 
36|72|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for  riding, some for food ? 
36|73|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give  thanks ? 
36|74|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be  helped. 
36|75|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them  a host in arms. 
36|76|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they  conceal and what proclaim. 
36|77|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he  is an open opponent. 
36|78|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his  creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? 
36|79|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower  of every creation, 
36|80|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle  from it. 
36|81|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of  them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, 
36|82|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:  Be! and it is. 
36|83|Ya Sin: Ya Sin|Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things!  Unto Him ye will be brought back. 
37|1|as-Saffat: The Rangers|By those who set the ranks in battle order 
37|2|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof 
37|3|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, 
37|4|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! thy Lord is surely One; 
37|5|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord  of the sun's risings. 
37|6|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; 
37|7|as-Saffat: The Rangers|With security from every froward devil. 
37|8|as-Saffat: The Rangers|They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, 
37|9|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; 
37|10|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. 
37|11|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those  (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. 
37|12|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock 
37|13|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And heed not when they are reminded, 
37|14|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. 
37|15|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; 
37|16|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth,  be raised (again) ? 
37|17|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And our forefathers ? 
37|18|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. 
37|19|as-Saffat: The Rangers|There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, 
37|20|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. 
37|21|as-Saffat: The Rangers|This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. 
37|22|as-Saffat: The Rangers|(And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together  with their wives and what they used to worship 
37|23|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; 
37|24|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And stop them, for they must be questioned. 
37|25|as-Saffat: The Rangers|What aileth you that ye help not one another ? 
37|26|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Nay, but this day they make full submission. 
37|27|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. 
37|28|as-Saffat: The Rangers|They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke  the truth). 
37|29|as-Saffat: The Rangers|They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. 
37|30|as-Saffat: The Rangers|We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. 
37|31|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are  about to taste (the doom). 
37|32|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. 
37|33|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. 
37|34|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. 
37|35|as-Saffat: The Rangers|For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were  scornful 
37|36|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? 
37|37|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). 
37|38|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - 
37|39|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Ye are requited naught save what ye did - 
37|40|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save single-minded slaves of Allah; 
37|41|as-Saffat: The Rangers|For them there is a known provision, 
37|42|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Fruits. And they will be honoured 
37|43|as-Saffat: The Rangers|In the Gardens of delight, 
37|44|as-Saffat: The Rangers|On couches facing one another; 
37|45|as-Saffat: The Rangers|A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, 
37|46|as-Saffat: The Rangers|White, delicious to the drinkers, 
37|47|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. 
37|48|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, 
37|49|as-Saffat: The Rangers|(Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). 
37|50|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. 
37|51|as-Saffat: The Rangers|A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade 
37|52|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? 
37|53|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we  (then) verily be brought to book ? 
37|54|as-Saffat: The Rangers|He saith: Will ye look ? 
37|55|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. 
37|56|as-Saffat: The Rangers|He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, 
37|57|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled  forth (to doom). 
37|58|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Are we then not to die 
37|59|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? 
37|60|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! this is the supreme triumph. 
37|61|as-Saffat: The Rangers|For the like of this, then, let the workers work. 
37|62|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? 
37|63|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. 
37|64|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. 
37|65|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Its crop is as it were the heads of devils 
37|66|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. 
37|67|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water 
37|68|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. 
37|69|as-Saffat: The Rangers|They indeed found their fathers astray, 
37|70|as-Saffat: The Rangers|But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. 
37|71|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, 
37|72|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And verily We sent among them warners. 
37|73|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, 
37|74|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
37|75|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer 
37|76|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We saved him and his household from the great distress, 
37|77|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And made his seed the survivors, 
37|78|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
37|79|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! 
37|80|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
37|81|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. 
37|82|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then We did drown the others. 
37|83|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham 
37|84|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; 
37|85|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? 
37|86|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? 
37|87|as-Saffat: The Rangers|What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? 
37|88|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And he glanced a glance at the stars 
37|89|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then said: Lo! I feel sick! 
37|90|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And they turned their backs and went away from him. 
37|91|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? 
37|92|as-Saffat: The Rangers|What aileth you that ye speak not ? 
37|93|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. 
37|94|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And (his people) came toward him, hastening. 
37|95|as-Saffat: The Rangers|He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve 
37|96|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? 
37|97|as-Saffat: The Rangers|They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. 
37|98|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. 
37|99|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. 
37|100|as-Saffat: The Rangers|My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. 
37|101|as-Saffat: The Rangers|So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. 
37|102|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my  dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou  ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt  find me of the steadfast. 
37|103|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down  upon his face, 
37|104|as-Saffat: The Rangers|We called unto him: O Abraham! 
37|105|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
37|106|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! that verily was a clear test. 
37|107|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. 
37|108|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
37|109|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Peace be unto Abraham! 
37|110|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Thus do We reward the good. 
37|111|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. 
37|112|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. 
37|113|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and  some who plainly wrong themselves. 
37|114|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, 
37|115|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And saved them and their people from the great distress, 
37|116|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And helped them so that they became the victors. 
37|117|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We gave them the clear Scripture 
37|118|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And showed them the right path. 
37|119|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): 
37|120|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! 
37|121|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
37|122|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. 
37|123|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), 
37|124|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 
37|125|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, 
37|126|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? 
37|127|as-Saffat: The Rangers|But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) 
37|128|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
37|129|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): 
37|130|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Peace be unto Elias! 
37|131|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! thus do We reward the good. 
37|132|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. 
37|133|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). 
37|134|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When We saved him and his household, every one, 
37|135|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; 
37|136|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then We destroyed the others. 
37|137|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning 
37|138|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? 
37|139|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) 
37|140|as-Saffat: The Rangers|When he fled unto the laden ship, 
37|141|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And then drew lots and was of those rejected; 
37|142|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; 
37|143|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) 
37|144|as-Saffat: The Rangers|He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; 
37|145|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; 
37|146|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; 
37|147|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more 
37|148|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. 
37|149|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have  sons ? 
37|150|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Or created We the angels females while they were present ? 
37|151|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: 
37|152|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. 
37|153|as-Saffat: The Rangers|(And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. 
37|154|as-Saffat: The Rangers|What aileth you ? How judge ye ? 
37|155|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Will ye not then reflect ? 
37|156|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Or have ye a clear warrant ? 
37|157|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. 
37|158|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know  well that they will be brought before (Him). 
37|159|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), 
37|160|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save single-minded slaves of Allah. 
37|161|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, 
37|162|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. 
37|163|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Save him who is to burn in hell. 
37|164|as-Saffat: The Rangers|There is not one of us but hath his known position. 
37|165|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, 
37|166|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise 
37|167|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And indeed they used to say: 
37|168|as-Saffat: The Rangers|If we had but a reminder from the men of old 
37|169|as-Saffat: The Rangers|We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. 
37|170|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. 
37|171|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) 
37|172|as-Saffat: The Rangers|That they verily would be helped, 
37|173|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And that Our host, they verily would be the victors. 
37|174|as-Saffat: The Rangers|So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile, 
37|175|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And watch, for they will (soon) see. 
37|176|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Would they hasten on Our doom ? 
37|177|as-Saffat: The Rangers|But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those  who have been warned. 
37|178|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Withdraw from them awhile 
37|179|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And watch, for they will (soon) see. 
37|180|as-Saffat: The Rangers|Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute  (unto Him) 
37|181|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And peace be unto those sent (to warn). 
37|182|as-Saffat: The Rangers|And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! 
38|1|Sad: Sad|Sad. By the renowned Qur'an, 
38|2|Sad: Sad|Nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism. 
38|3|Sad: Sad|How many a generation We destroyed before them, and they cried out when  it was no longer the time for escape! 
38|4|Sad: Sad|And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them,  and the disbelievers say: This is a wizard, a charlatan. 
38|5|Sad: Sad|Maketh he the gods One God ? Lo! that is an astounding thing. 
38|6|Sad: Sad|The chiefs among them go about, exhorting: Go and be staunch to your gods!  Lo! this is a thing designed. 
38|7|Sad: Sad|We have not heard of this in later religion. This is naught but an invention. 
38|8|Sad: Sad|Hath the reminder been unto him (alone) among us ? Nay, but they are in  doubt concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom. 
38|9|Sad: Sad|Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the  Bestower ? 
38|10|Sad: Sad|Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  theirs ? Then let them ascend by ropes! 
38|11|Sad: Sad|A defeated host are (all) the factions that are there. 
38|12|Sad: Sad|The folk of Noah before them denied (their messenger) and (so did the tribe  of) A'ad, and Pharaoh firmly planted, 
38|13|Sad: Sad|And (the tribe of) Thamud, and the folk of Lot, and the dwellers in the wood:  these were the factions. 
38|14|Sad: Sad|Not one of them but did deny the messengers, therefor My doom was  justified, 
38|15|Sad: Sad|These wait for but one Shout, there will be no second thereto. 
38|16|Sad: Sad|They say: Our Lord! Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning. 
38|17|Sad: Sad|Bear with what they say, and remember Our bondman David, lord of might,  Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). 
38|18|Sad: Sad|Lo! We subdued the hills to hymn the praises (of their Lord) with him at  nightfall and sunrise, 
38|19|Sad: Sad|And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him. 
38|20|Sad: Sad|We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech. 
38|21|Sad: Sad|And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee ? How they climbed the  wall into the royal chamber; 
38|22|Sad: Sad|How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not  afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefor judge  aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way. 
38|23|Sad: Sad|Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe; and he  said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech. 
38|24|Sad: Sad|(David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to  his ewes, and lo! many partners oppress one another, save such as believe and do  good works, and they are few. And David guessed that We had tried him, and he  sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and  repented. 
38|25|Sad: Sad|So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy  journey's end. 
38|26|Sad: Sad|(And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a viceroy in  the earth; therefor judge aright between mankind, and follow not desire that it beguile  thee from the way of Allah. Lo! those who wander from the way of Allah have an  awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning. 
38|27|Sad: Sad|And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in  vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe unto those who disbelieve,  from the Fire! 
38|28|Sad: Sad|Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread  corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the wicked ? 
38|29|Sad: Sad|(This is) a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing, that  they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may reflect. 
38|30|Sad: Sad|And We bestowed on David, Solomon. How excellent a slave! Lo! he was  ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). 
38|31|Sad: Sad|When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers 
38|32|Sad: Sad|And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things (of the world) to the  remembrance of my Lord; till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain. 
38|33|Sad: Sad|(Then he said): Bring them back to me, and fell to slashing (with his sword  their) legs and necks. 
38|34|Sad: Sad|And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a (mere) body. Then  did he repent. 
38|35|Sad: Sad|He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall  not belong to any after me. Lo! Thou art the Bestower. 
38|36|Sad: Sad|So We made the wind subservient unto him, setting fair by his command  whithersoever he intended. 
38|37|Sad: Sad|And the unruly, every builder and diver (made We subservient), 
38|38|Sad: Sad|And others linked together in chains, 
38|39|Sad: Sad|(Saying): This is Our gift, so bestow thou, or withhold, without reckoning. 
38|40|Sad: Sad|And lo! he hath favour with Us, and a happy journey's end. 
38|41|Sad: Sad|And make mention (O Muhammad) of Our bondman Job, when he cried unto  his Lord (saying): Lo! the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment. 
38|42|Sad: Sad|(And it was said unto him): Strike the ground with thy foot. This (spring) is a  cool bath and a refreshing drink. 
38|43|Sad: Sad|And We bestowed on him (again) his household and therewith the like  thereof, a mercy from Us, and a memorial for men of understanding. 
38|44|Sad: Sad|And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith,  and break not thine oath. Lo! We found him steadfast, how excellent a slave! Lo! he  was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord). 
38|45|Sad: Sad|And make mention of Our bondmen, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of parts  and vision. 
38|46|Sad: Sad|Lo! We purified them with a pure thought, remembrance of the Home (of the  Hereafter). 
38|47|Sad: Sad|Lo! in Our sight they are verily of the elect, the excellent. 
38|48|Sad: Sad|And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. All are of the  chosen. 
38|49|Sad: Sad|This is a reminder. And lo! for those who ward off (evil) is a happy journey's  end, 
38|50|Sad: Sad|Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them, 
38|51|Sad: Sad|Wherein, reclining, they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink (that is)  therein. 
38|52|Sad: Sad|And with them are those of modest gaze, companions. 
38|53|Sad: Sad|This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning. 
38|54|Sad: Sad|Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away. 
38|55|Sad: Sad|This (is for the righteous). And lo! for the transgressors there with be an evil  journey's end, 
38|56|Sad: Sad|Hell, where they will burn, an evil resting-place. 
38|57|Sad: Sad|Here is a boiling and an ice-cold draught, so let them taste it, 
38|58|Sad: Sad|And other (torment) of the kind in pairs (the two extremes)! 
38|59|Sad: Sad|Here is an army rushing blindly with you. (Those who are already in the Fire  say): No word of welcome for them. Lo! they will roast at the Fire. 
38|60|Sad: Sad|They say: Nay, but you (misleaders), for you there is no word of welcome.  Ye prepared this for us (by your misleading). Now hapless is the plight. 
38|61|Sad: Sad|They say: Our Lord! Whoever did prepare this for us, oh, give him double  portion of the Fire! 
38|62|Sad: Sad|And they say: What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to  count among the wicked ? 
38|63|Sad: Sad|Did we take them (wrongly) for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed  them ? 
38|64|Sad: Sad|Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire. 
38|65|Sad: Sad|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I am only a warner, and there is no God  save Allah, the One, the Absolute, 
38|66|Sad: Sad|Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty,  the Pardoning. 
38|67|Sad: Sad|Say: It is tremendous tidings 
38|68|Sad: Sad|Whence ye turn away! 
38|69|Sad: Sad|I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed; 
38|70|Sad: Sad|It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner. 
38|71|Sad: Sad|When thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of  mire, 
38|72|Sad: Sad|And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall  down before him prostrate, 
38|73|Sad: Sad|The angels fell down prostrate, every one, 
38|74|Sad: Sad|Saving Iblis; he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers. 
38|75|Sad: Sad|He said: O Iblis! What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which  I have created with both My hands ? Art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted  ? 
38|76|Sad: Sad|He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou  didst create of clay. 
38|77|Sad: Sad|He said: Go forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast, 
38|78|Sad: Sad|And lo! My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment. 
38|79|Sad: Sad|He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. 
38|80|Sad: Sad|He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved 
38|81|Sad: Sad|Until the day of the time appointed. 
38|82|Sad: Sad|He said: Then, by Thy might, I surely will beguile them every one, 
38|83|Sad: Sad|Save Thy single-minded slaves among them. 
38|84|Sad: Sad|He said: The Truth is, and the Truth I speak, 
38|85|Sad: Sad|That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee, together. 
38|86|Sad: Sad|Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for this, and I am no  simulating. 
38|87|Sad: Sad|Lo! it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples 
38|88|Sad: Sad|And ye will come in time to know the truth thereof. 
39|1|az-Zumar: The Companies|The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. 
39|2|az-Zumar: The Companies|Lo! We have revealed the Scripture unto thee (Muhammad) with truth; so  worship Allah, making religion pure for Him (only). 
39|3|az-Zumar: The Companies|Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting  friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto  Allah. Lo! Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Lo!  Allah guideth not him who is a liar, an ingrate. 
39|4|az-Zumar: The Companies|If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of  that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute. 
39|5|az-Zumar: The Companies|He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to  succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and  the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the  Mighty, the Forgiver ? 
39|6|az-Zumar: The Companies|He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and  He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your  mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is  the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away ? 
39|7|az-Zumar: The Companies|If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased  with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith  for you. No laden soul will bear another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return;  and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of  men). 
39|8|az-Zumar: The Companies|And when some hurt toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning unto  Him (repentant). Then, when He granteth him a boon from Him he forgetteth that for  which he cried unto Him before, and setteth up rivals to Allah that he may beguile  (men) from his way. Say (O Muhammad, unto such an one): Take pleasure in thy  disbelief a while. Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire. 
39|9|az-Zumar: The Companies|Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night, prostrate and  standing, bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (to be  accounted equal with a disbeliever) ? Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Are those who  know equal with those who know not ? But only men of understanding will pay heed. 
39|10|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: O My bondmen who believe! Observe your duty to your Lord. For  those who do good in this world there is good, and Allah's earth is spacious. Verily  the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint. 
39|11|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say (O Muhammad): Lo! I am commanded to worship Allah, making  religion pure for Him (only). 
39|12|az-Zumar: The Companies|And I am commanded to be the first of those who are muslims (surrender  unto Him). 
39|13|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: Lo! if I should disobey my Lord, I fear the doom of a tremendous Day. 
39|14|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: Allah I worship, making my religion pure for Him (only). 
39|15|az-Zumar: The Companies|Then worship what ye will beside Him. Say: The losers will be those who  lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the  manifest loss! 
39|16|az-Zumar: The Companies|They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais (of fire).  With this doth Allah appal His bondmen. O My bondmen, therefor fear Me! 
39|17|az-Zumar: The Companies|And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn  to Allah in repentance, for them there are glad tidings. Therefor give good tidings (O  Muhammad) to My bondmen 
39|18|az-Zumar: The Companies|Who hear advice and follow the best thereof. Such are those whom Allah  guideth, and such are men of understanding. 
39|19|az-Zumar: The Companies|Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled (to be helped), and canst thou  (O Muhammad) rescue him who is in the Fire ? 
39|20|az-Zumar: The Companies|But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are lofty halls with  lofty halls above them, built (for them), beneath which rivers flow. (It is) a promise of  Allah. Allah faileth not His promise. 
39|21|az-Zumar: The Companies|Hast thou not seen how Allah hath sent down water from the sky and hath  caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings, and afterward thereby produceth  crops of divers hues; and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow; then  He maketh them chaff. Lo! herein verily is a reminder for men of understanding. 
39|22|az-Zumar: The Companies|Is he whose bosom Allah hath expanded for Al-Islam, so that he followeth a  light from his Lord, (as he who disbelieveth) ? Then woe unto those whose hearts are  hardened against remembrance of Allah. Such are in plain error. 
39|23|az-Zumar: The Companies|Allah hath (now) revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent,  (wherein promises of reward are) paired (with threats of punishment), whereat doth  creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their hearts soften  to Allah's reminder. Such is Allah's guidance, wherewith He guideth whom He will.  And him whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. 
39|24|az-Zumar: The Companies|Is he then, who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of  Resurrection (as he who doeth right) ? And it will be said unto the wrong-doers: Taste  what ye used to earn. 
39|25|az-Zumar: The Companies|Those before them denied, and so the doom came on them whence they  knew not. 
39|26|az-Zumar: The Companies|Thus Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world, and verily  the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know. 
39|27|az-Zumar: The Companies|And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur'an all kinds of  similitudes, that haply they may reflect; 
39|28|az-Zumar: The Companies|A Lecture in Arabic, containing no crookedness, that haply they may ward  off (evil). 
39|29|az-Zumar: The Companies|Allah coineth a similitude: A man in relation to whom are several part- owners, quarrelling, and a man belonging wholly to one man. Are the two equal in  similitude ? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not. 
39|30|az-Zumar: The Companies|Lo! thou wilt die, and lo! they will die; 
39|31|az-Zumar: The Companies|Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord ye will dispute. 
39|32|az-Zumar: The Companies|And who doth greater wrong than he who telleth a lie against Allah, and  denieth the truth when it reacheth him ? Will not the home of disbelievers be in hell ? 
39|33|az-Zumar: The Companies|And whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein - Such are the dutiful. 
39|34|az-Zumar: The Companies|They shall have what they will of their Lord's bounty. That is the reward of  the good: 
39|35|az-Zumar: The Companies|That Allah will remit from them the worst of what they did, and will pay  them for reward the best they used to do. 
39|36|az-Zumar: The Companies|Will not Allah defend His slave ? Yet they would frighten thee with those  beside Him. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. 
39|37|az-Zumar: The Companies|And he whom Allah guideth, for him there can be no misleader. Is not Allah  Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong) ? 
39|38|az-Zumar: The Companies|And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth  ? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah, if  Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or if He willed  some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy ? Say: Allah is my all. In Him do  (all) the trusting put their trust. 
39|39|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: O my people! Act in your manner. Lo! I (too) am acting. Thus ye will  come to know 
39|40|az-Zumar: The Companies|Who it is unto whom cometh a doom that will abase him, and on whom there  falleth everlasting doom. 
39|41|az-Zumar: The Companies|Lo! We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture for mankind  with truth. Then whosoever goeth right it is for his soul, and whosoever strayeth,  strayeth only to its hurt. And thou art not a warder over them. 
39|42|az-Zumar: The Companies|Allah receiveth (men's) souls at the time of their death, and that (soul) which  dieth not (yet) in its sleep. He keepeth that (soul) for which He hath ordained death  and dismisseth the rest till an appointed term. Lo! herein verily are portents for people  who take thought. 
39|43|az-Zumar: The Companies|Or choose they intercessors other than Allah ? Say: What! Even though they  have power over nothing and have no intelligence ? 
39|44|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: Unto Allah belongeth all intercession. His is the Sovereignty of the  heavens and the earth. And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back. 
39|45|az-Zumar: The Companies|And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in  the Hereafter are repelled, and when those (whom they worship) beside Him are  mentioned, behold! they are glad. 
39|46|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of the Invisible  and the Visible! Thou wilt judge between Thy slaves concerning that wherein they  used to differ. 
39|47|az-Zumar: The Companies|And though those who do wrong possess all that is in the earth, and therewith  as much again, they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of  Resurrection from the awful doom; and there will appear unto them, from their Lord,  that wherewith they never reckoned. 
39|48|az-Zumar: The Companies|And the evils that they earned will appear unto them, and that whereat they  used to scoff will surround them. 
39|49|az-Zumar: The Companies|Now when hurt toucheth a man he crieth unto Us, and afterward when We  have granted him a boon from Us, he saith: Only by force of knowledge I obtained it.  Nay, but it is a test. But most of them know not. 
39|50|az-Zumar: The Companies|Those before them said it, yet (all) that they had earned availed them not; 
39|51|az-Zumar: The Companies|But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong, the  evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape. 
39|52|az-Zumar: The Companies|Know they not that Allah enlargeth providence for whom He will, and  straiteneth it (for whom He will). Lo! herein verily are portents for people who  believe. 
39|53|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say: O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of  the mercy of Allah, Who forgiveth all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
39|54|az-Zumar: The Companies|Turn unto your Lord repentant, and surrender unto Him, before there come  unto you the doom, when ye cannot be helped. 
39|55|az-Zumar: The Companies|And follow the better (guidance) of that which is revealed unto you from  your Lord, before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not, 
39|56|az-Zumar: The Companies|Lest any soul should say: Alas, my grief that I was unmindful of Allah, and I  was indeed among the scoffers! 
39|57|az-Zumar: The Companies|Or should say: If Allah had but guided me I should have been among the  dutiful! 
39|58|az-Zumar: The Companies|Or should say, when it seeth the doom: Oh, that I had but a second chance  that I might be among the righteous! 
39|59|az-Zumar: The Companies|(But now the answer will be): Nay, for My revelations came unto thee, but  thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers. 
39|60|az-Zumar: The Companies|And on the Day of Resurrection thou (Muhammad) seest those who lied  concerning Allah with their faces blackened. Is not the home of the scorners in hell ? 
39|61|az-Zumar: The Companies|And Allah delivereth those who ward off (evil) because of their deserts. Evil  toucheth them not, nor do they grieve. 
39|62|az-Zumar: The Companies|Allah is Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things. 
39|63|az-Zumar: The Companies|His are the keys of the heavens and the earth, and they who disbelieve the  revelations of Allah - such are they who are the losers. 
39|64|az-Zumar: The Companies|Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): Do ye bid me serve other than  Allah ? O ye fools! 
39|65|az-Zumar: The Companies|And verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee (saying):  If thou ascribe a partner to Allah thy work will fail and thou indeed wilt be among the  losers. 
39|66|az-Zumar: The Companies|Nay, but Allah must thou serve, and be among the thankful! 
39|67|az-Zumar: The Companies|And they esteem not Allah as He hath the right to be esteemed, when the  whole earth is His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens are rolled in  His right hand. Glorified is He and High Exalted from all that they ascribe as partner  (unto Him). 
39|68|az-Zumar: The Companies|And the trumpet is blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are in  the earth swoon away, save him whom Allah willeth. Then it is blown a second time,  and behold them standing waiting! 
39|69|az-Zumar: The Companies|And the earth shineth with the light of her Lord, and the Book is set up, and  the prophets and the witnesses are brought, and it is judged between them with truth,  and they are not wronged. 
39|70|az-Zumar: The Companies|And each soul is paid in full for what it did. And He is Best Aware of what  they do. 
39|71|az-Zumar: The Companies|And those who disbelieve are driven unto hell in troops till, when they reach  it and the gates thereof are opened, and the warders thereof say unto them: Came  there not unto you messengers of your own, reciting unto you the revelations of your  Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day ? they say: Yea, verily. But the  word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled. 
39|72|az-Zumar: The Companies|It is said (unto them): Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein. Thus  hapless is the journey's end of the scorners. 
39|73|az-Zumar: The Companies|And those who keep their duty to their Lord are driven unto the Garden in  troops till, when they reach it, and the gates thereof are opened, and the warders  thereof say unto them: Peace be unto you! Ye are good, so enter ye (the Garden of  delight), to dwell therein; 
39|74|az-Zumar: The Companies|They say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath fulfilled His promise unto us and  hath made us inherit the land, sojourning in the Garden where we will! So bounteous  is the wage of workers. 
39|75|az-Zumar: The Companies|And thou (O Muhammad) seest the angels thronging round the Throne,  hymning the praises of their Lord. And they are judged aright. And it is said: Praise  be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! 
40|1|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Ha. Mim. 
40|2|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knower, 
40|3|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of repentance, the Stern in punishment, the  Bountiful. There is no God save Him. Unto Him is the journeying. 
40|4|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve,  so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee (O Muhammad). 
40|5|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied (their messengers)  before these, and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely,  (thinking) thereby to refute the Truth. Then I seized them, and how (awful) was My  punishment. 
40|6|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Thus was the word of thy Lord concerning those who disbelieve fulfilled:  That they are owners of the Fire. 
40|7|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises  of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying):  Our Lord! Thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge, therefor forgive  those who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them the punishment of hell. 
40|8|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens of Eden which thou hast  promised them, with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do  right. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. 
40|9|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And ward off from them ill-deeds; and he from whom Thou wardest off ill- deeds that day, him verily hast Thou taken into mercy. That is the supreme triumph. 
40|10|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Lo! (on that day) those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation: Verily  Allah's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another, when ye  were called unto the faith but did refuse. 
40|11|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|They say: Our Lord! Twice hast Thou made us die, and twice hast Thou  made us live. Now we confess our sins. Is there any way to go out ? 
40|12|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|(It is said unto them): This is (your plight) because, when Allah only was  invoked, ye disbelieved, but when some partner was ascribed to Him ye were  believing. But the command belongeth only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic. 
40|13|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|He it is Who showeth you His portents, and sendeth down for you provision  from the sky. None payeth heed save him who turneth (unto Him) repentant. 
40|14|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Therefor (O believers) pray unto Allah, making religion pure for Him (only),  however much the disbelievers be averse - 
40|15|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The Exalter of Ranks, the Lord of the Throne. He causeth the Spirit of His  command upon whom He will of His slaves, that He may warn of the Day of  Meeting, 
40|16|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The day when they come forth, nothing of them being hidden from Allah.  Whose is the Sovereignty this day ? It is Allah's, the One, the Almighty. 
40|17|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|This day is each soul requited that which it hath earned; no wrong (is done)  this day. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning. 
40|18|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of the approaching (doom), when the  hearts will be choking the throats, (when) there will be no friend for the wrong-doers,  nor any intercessor who will be heard. 
40|19|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms hide. 
40|20|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Allah judgeth with truth, while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge  not at all. Lo! Allah, He is the Hearer, the Seer. 
40|21|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those who disbelieved before them ? They were mightier than these in power and (in  the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their  sins, and they had no protector from Allah. 
40|22|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs (of  Allah's Sovereignty) but they disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Lo! He is Strong,  severe in punishment. 
40|23|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant 
40|24|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer! 
40|25|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the  sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of  disbelievers is in naught but error. 
40|26|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord.  Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land. 
40|27|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner  who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. 
40|28|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye  kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from  your Lord ? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of  that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah guideth not one who is a  prodigal, a liar. 
40|29|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|O my people! Yours is the kingdom to-day, ye being uppermost in the land.  But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it reach us ? Pharaoh said: I  do but show you what I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy. 
40|30|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And he who believed said: O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of  the factions (of old); 
40|31|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after them,  and Allah willeth no injustice for (His) slaves. 
40|32|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a Day of Summoning, 
40|33|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|A day when ye will turn to flee, having no preserver from Allah: and he  whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. 
40|34|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in  doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send  any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter. 
40|35|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without any warrant  that hath come unto them, it is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of  those who believe. Thus doth Allah print on every arrogant, disdainful heart. 
40|36|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a tower that haply I may reach  the roads, 
40|37|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The roads of the heavens, and may look upon the God of Moses, though  verily I think him a liar. Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh,  and he was debarred from the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin. 
40|38|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And he who believed said: O my people! Follow me. I will show you the  way of right conduct. 
40|39|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|O my people! Lo! this life of the world is but a passing comfort, and lo! the  Hereafter, that is the enduring home. 
40|40|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Whoso doeth an ill-deed, he will be repaid the like thereof, while whoso  doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, (all) such will enter the  Garden, where they will be nourished without stint. 
40|41|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And, O my people! What aileth me that I call you unto deliverance when ye  call me unto the Fire ? 
40|42|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe unto Him as partners that  whereof I have no knowledge, while I call you unto the Mighty, the Forgiver. 
40|43|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim in the world or in the  Hereafter, and our return will be unto Allah, and the prodigals will be owners of the  Fire. 
40|44|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And ye will remember what I say unto you. I confide my cause unto Allah.  Lo! Allah is Seer of (His) slaves. 
40|45|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted, while a dreadful  doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk, 
40|46|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening; and on the day when  the Hour upriseth (it is said): Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom. 
40|47|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And when they wrangle in the Fire, the weak say unto those who were proud:  Lo! we were a following unto you; will ye therefor rid us of a portion of the Fire ? 
40|48|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Those who were proud say: Lo! we are all (together) herein. Lo! Allah hath  judged between (His) slaves. 
40|49|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And those in the Fire say unto the guards of hell: Entreat your Lord that He  relieve us of a day of the torment. 
40|50|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|They say: Came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs ? They say:  Yea, verily. They say: Then do ye pray, although the prayer of disbelievers is in vain. 
40|51|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Lo! We verily do help Our messengers, and those who believe, in the life of  the world and on the day when the witnesses arise, 
40|52|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|The day when their excuse availeth not the evil-doers, and theirs is the curse,  and theirs the ill abode. 
40|53|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And We verily gave Moses the guidance, and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit the Scripture, 
40|54|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|A guide and a reminder for men of understanding. 
40|55|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And  ask forgiveness of thy sin, and hymn the praise of thy Lord at fall of night and in the  early hours. 
40|56|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Lo! those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without a warrant  having come unto them, there is naught else in their breasts save pride which they  will never attain. So take thou refuge in Allah. Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the  Seer. 
40|57|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the  creation of mankind; but most of mankind know not. 
40|58|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And the blind man and the seer are not equal, neither are those who believe  and do good works (equal with) the evil-doer. Little do ye reflect! 
40|59|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Lo! the Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt thereof; yet most of  mankind believe not. 
40|60|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And your Lord hath said: Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer. Lo!  those who scorn My service, they will enter hell, disgraced. 
40|61|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Allah it is Who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein, and  day for seeing. Lo! Allah is a Lord of bounty for mankind, yet most of mankind give  not thanks. 
40|62|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, There is no God save  Him. How then are ye perverted ? 
40|63|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of Allah. 
40|64|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Allah it is Who appointed for you the earth for a dwelling-place and the sky  for a canopy, and fashioned you and perfected your shapes, and hath provided you  with good things. Such is Allah, your Lord. Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the  Worlds! 
40|65|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|He is the Living One. There is no God save Him. So pray unto Him, making  religion pure for Him (only). Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! 
40|66|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Say (O Muhammad): I am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry  beside Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord, and I am  commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds. 
40|67|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|He it is Who created you from dust, then from a drop (of seed) then from a  clot, then bringeth you forth as a child, then (ordaineth) that ye attain full strength and  afterward that ye become old men - though some among you die before - and that ye  reach an appointed term, that haply ye may understand. 
40|68|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|He it is Who quickeneth and giveth death. When He ordaineth a thing, He  saith unto it only: Be! and it is. 
40|69|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah,  how they are turned away ? - 
40|70|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Those who deny the Scripture and that wherewith We send Our messengers.  But they will come to know, 
40|71|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|When carcans are about their necks and chains. They are dragged 
40|72|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Through boiling waters; then they are thrust into the Fire. 
40|73|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Then it is said unto them: Where are (all) that ye used to make partners (in  the Sovereignty) 
40|74|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Beside Allah ? They say: They have failed us; but we used not to pray to  anything before. Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance). 
40|75|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|(And it is said unto them): This is because ye exulted in the earth without  right, and because ye were petulant. 
40|76|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein. Evil is the habitation of the  scornful. 
40|77|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And  whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them, or (whether) We cause  thee to die, still unto Us they will be brought back. 
40|78|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We  have told thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any  messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah's leave, but when Allah's  commandment cometh (the cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will  then be lost. 
40|79|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle, that ye may ride on some of  them, and eat of some - 
40|80|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|(Many) benefits ye have from them - and that ye may satisfy by their means  a need that is in your breasts, and may be borne upon them as upon the ship. 
40|81|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And He showeth you His tokens. Which, then, of the tokens of Allah do ye  deny ? 
40|82|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those before them ? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and  (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. But all that they used to earn  availed them not. 
40|83|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|And when their messengers brought them clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) they exulted in the knowledge they (themselves) possessed. And that  which they were wont to mock befell them. 
40|84|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|Then, when they saw Our doom, they said: We believe in Allah only and  reject (all) that we used to associate (with Him). 
40|85|al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One|But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom. This is Allah's  law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will be  ruined. 
41|1|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Ha. Mim. 
41|2|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|A revelation from the Beneficent, the Merciful, 
41|3|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|A Scripture whereof the verses are expounded, a Lecture in Arabic for  people who have knowledge, 
41|4|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Good tidings and a warning. But most of them turn away so that they hear  not. 
41|5|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And they say: Our hearts are protected from that unto which thou (O  Muhammad) callest us, and in our ears there is a deafness, and between us and thee  there is a veil. Act, then. Lo! we also shall be acting. 
41|6|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Say (unto them O Muhammad): I am only a mortal like you. It is inspired in  me that your God is One God, therefor take the straight path unto Him and seek  forgiveness of Him. And woe unto the idolaters, 
41|7|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Who give not the poor-due, and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. 
41|8|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Lo! as for those who believe and do good works, for them is a reward  enduring. 
41|9|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Say (O Muhammad, unto the idolaters): Disbelieve ye verily in Him Who  created the earth in two Days, and ascribe ye unto Him rivals ? He (and none else) is  the Lord of the Worlds. 
41|10|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|He placed therein firm hills rising above it, and blessed it and measured  therein its sustenance in four Days, alike for (all) who ask; 
41|11|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto  the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient. 
41|12|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Then He ordained them seven heavens in two Days and inspired in each  heaven its mandate; and We decked the nether heaven with lamps, and rendered it  inviolable. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Knower. 
41|13|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|But if they turn away, then say: I warn you of a thunderbolt like the  thunderbolt (which fell of old upon the tribes) of A'ad and Thamud; 
41|14|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|When their messengers came unto them from before them and behind them,  saying: Worship none but Allah! they said: If our Lord had willed, He surely would  have sent down angels (unto us), so lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have  been sent. 
41|15|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|As for A'ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: Who  is mightier than us in power ? Could they not see that Allah Who created them, He  was mightier than them in power ? And they denied Our revelations. 
41|16|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Therefor We let loose on them a raging wind in evil days, that We might  make them taste the torment of disgrace in the life of the world. And verily the doom  of the Hereafter will be more shameful, and they will not be helped. 
41|17|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness to  the guidance, so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of what  they used to earn. 
41|18|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And We delivered those who believed and used to keep their duty to Allah. 
41|19|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And (make mention of) the day when the enemies of Allah are gathered unto  the Fire, they are driven on 
41|20|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Till, when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify  against them as to what they used to do. 
41|21|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And they say unto their skins: Why testify ye against us ? They say: Allah  hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things, and Who created you at the  first, and unto Whom ye are returned. 
41|22|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins  should testify against you, but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye did. 
41|23|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|That, your thought which ye did think about your Lord, hath ruined you; and  ye find yourselves (this day) among the lost. 
41|24|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And though they are resigned, yet the Fire is still their home; and if they ask  for favour, yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown. 
41|25|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And We assigned them comrades (in the world), who made their present and  their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and  humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were ever  losers. 
41|26|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Those who disbelieve say: Heed not this Qur'an, and drown the hearing of it;  haply ye may conquer. 
41|27|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|But verily We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom, and  verily We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do. 
41|28|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|That is the reward of Allah's enemies: the Fire. Therein is their immortal  home, payment forasmuch as they denied Our revelations. 
41|29|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And those who disbelieve will say: Our Lord! Show us those who beguiled  us of the jinn and humankind. We will place them underneath our feet that they may  be among the nethermost. 
41|30|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and afterward are upright, the angels  descend upon them, saying: Fear not nor grieve, but hear good tidings of the paradise  which ye are promised. 
41|31|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the Hereafter.  There ye will have (all) that your souls desire, and there ye will have (all) for which  ye pray. 
41|32|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|A gift of welcome from One Forgiving, Merciful. 
41|33|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his Lord and doeth  right, and saith: Lo! I am of those who are muslims (surrender unto Him). 
41|34|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one  which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become)  as though he was a bosom friend. 
41|35|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|But none is granted it save those who are steadfast, and none is granted it  save the owner of great happiness. 
41|36|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And if a whisper from the devil reach thee (O Muhammad) then seek refuge  in Allah. Lo! He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
41|37|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And of His portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon.  Adore not the sun not the moon; but adore Allah Who created them, if it is in truth  Him Whom ye worship. 
41|38|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|But if they are too proud - still those who are with thy Lord glorify Him  night and day, and tire not. 
41|39|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And of His portents (is this): that thou seest the earth lowly, but when We  send down water thereon it thrilleth and groweth. Lo! He Who quickeneth it is verily  the Quickener of the Dead. Lo! He is Able to do all things. 
41|40|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Lo! those who distort Our revelations are not hid from Us. Is he who is  hurled into the Fire better, or he who cometh secure on the Day of Resurrection ? Do  what ye will. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do. 
41|41|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Lo! those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it cometh unto them (are  guilty), for lo! it is an unassailable Scripture. 
41|42|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it. (It is) a  revelation from the Wise, the Owner of Praise. 
41|43|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Naught is said unto thee (Muhammad) save what was said unto the  messengers before thee. Lo! thy Lord is owner of forgiveness, and owner (also) of  dire punishment. 
41|44|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would  assuredly have said: If only its verses were expounded (so that we might understand)  ? What! A foreign tongue and an Arab ? - Say unto them (O Muhammad): For those  who believe it is a guidance and a healing; and as for those who disbelieve, there is a  deafness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. Such are called to from afar. 
41|45|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, but there hath been dispute  concerning it; and but for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, it would  ere now have been judged between them; but lo! they are in hopeless doubt  concerning it. 
41|46|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Whoso doeth right it is for his soul, and whoso doeth wrong it is against it.  And thy Lord is not at all a tyrant to His slaves. 
41|47|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Unto Him is referred (all) knowledge of the Hour. And no fruits burst forth  from their sheaths, and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with His knowledge.  And on the day when He calleth unto them: Where are now My partners ? they will  say: We confess unto Thee, not one of us is a witness (for them). 
41|48|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And those to whom they used to cry of old have failed them, and they  perceive they have no place of refuge. 
41|49|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Man tireth not of praying for good, and if ill toucheth him, then he is  disheartened, desperate. 
41|50|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|And verily, if We cause him to taste mercy after some hurt that hath touched  him, he will say: This is my own; and I deem not that the Hour will ever rise, and if I  am brought back to my Lord, I surely shall be better off with Him - But We verily  shall tell those who disbelieve (all) that they did, and We verily shall make them taste  hard punishment. 
41|51|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|When We show favour unto man, he withdraweth and turneth aside, but  when ill toucheth him then he aboundeth in prayer. 
41|52|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye reject it - Who is further astray than  one who is at open feud (with Allah) ? 
41|53|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|We shall show them Our portents on the horizons and within themselves  until it will be manifest unto them that it is the Truth. Doth not thy Lord suffice, since  He is Witness over all things ? 
41|54|Ha Mim Sajdah: Revelations Well Expounded|How! Are they still in doubt about the meeting with their Lord ? Lo! Is not  He surrounding all things ? 
42|1|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Ha. Mim. 
42|2|ash-Shura: The Counsel|A'in. Sin. Qaf. 
42|3|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Thus Allah the Mighty, the Knower inspireth thee (Muhammad) as (He  inspired) those before thee. 
42|4|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and  He is the Sublime, the Tremendous. 
42|5|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the  praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Lo! Allah, He is the  Forgiver, the Merciful. 
42|6|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him, Allah is Warden  over them, and thou art in no wise a guardian over them. 
42|7|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic, that thou mayst warn  the mother-town and those around it, and mayst warn of a day of assembling whereof  there is no doubt. A host will be in the Garden, and a host of them in the Flame. 
42|8|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community, but Allah  bringeth whom He will into His mercy. And the wrong-doers have no friend nor  helper. 
42|9|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Or have they chosen protecting friends besides Him ? But Allah, He (alone)  is the Protecting Friend. He quickeneth the dead, and He is Able to do all things. 
42|10|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And in whatsoever ye differ, the verdict therein belongeth to Allah. Such is  my Lord, in Whom I put my trust, and unto Whom I turn. 
42|11|ash-Shura: The Counsel|The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He hath made for you pairs of  yourselves, and of the cattle also pairs, whereby He multiplieth you. Naught is as His  likeness; and He is the Hearer, the Seer. 
42|12|ash-Shura: The Counsel|His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlargeth providence for  whom He will and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! He is Knower of all things. 
42|13|ash-Shura: The Counsel|He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and  that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto  Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided  therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth  for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him). 
42|14|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them,  through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already  gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between  them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in  hopeless doubt concerning it. 
42|15|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Unto this, then, summon (O Muhammad). And be thou upright as thou art  commanded, and follow not their lusts, but say: I believe in whatever scripture Allah  hath sent down, and I am commanded to be just among you. Allah is our Lord and  your Lord. Unto us our works and unto you your works; no argument between us and  you. Allah will bring us together, and unto Him is the journeying. 
42|16|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged,  their argument hath no weight with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will  be an awful doom. 
42|17|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth, and the Balance. How  canst thou know ? It may be that the Hour is nigh. 
42|18|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are  fearful of it and know that it is the Truth. Are not they who dispute, in doubt  concerning the Hour, far astray ? 
42|19|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Allah is gracious unto His slaves. He provideth for whom He will. And He is  the Strong, the Mighty. 
42|20|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him increase in its  harvest. And whoso desireth the harvest of the world, We give him thereof, and he  hath no portion in the Hereafter. 
42|21|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Or have they partners (of Allah) who have made lawful for them in religion  that which Allah allowed not ? And but for a decisive word (gone forth already), it  would have been judged between them. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom. 
42|22|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Thou seest the wrong-doers fearful of that which they have earned, and it  will surely befall them, while those who believe and do good works (will be) in  flowering meadows of the Gardens, having what they wish from their Lord. This is  the great preferment. 
42|23|ash-Shura: The Counsel|This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do  good works. Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee therefor, save  lovingkindness among kinsfolk. And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its  good for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Responsive. 
42|24|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Or say they: He hath invented a lie concerning Allah ? If Allah willed, He  could have sealed thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie and will  vindicate the truth by His words. Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of  men). 
42|25|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen, and pardoneth  the evil deeds, and knoweth what ye do, 
42|26|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And accepteth those who do good works, and giveth increase unto them of  His bounty. And as for disbelievers, theirs will be an awful doom. 
42|27|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely  rebel in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth. Lo! He is  Informed, a Seer of His bondmen. 
42|28|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And He it is Who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired,  and spreadeth out His mercy. He is the Protecting Friend, the Praiseworthy. 
42|29|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And of His portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth, and of  whatever beasts He hath dispersed therein. And He is Able to gather them when He  will. 
42|30|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Whatever of misfortune striketh you, it is what your right hands have earned.  And He forgiveth much. 
42|31|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Ye cannot escape in the earth, for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend  nor any helper. 
42|32|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And of His portents are the ships, like banners on the sea; 
42|33|ash-Shura: The Counsel|If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface - Lo!  herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful (heart). - 
42|34|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned -  And He forgiveth much - 
42|35|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have  no refuge. 
42|36|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the  world, and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and  put their trust in their Lord, 
42|37|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and, when they are  wroth, forgive, 
42|38|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and  whose affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on  them, 
42|39|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And those who, when great wrong is done to them, defend themselves, 
42|40|ash-Shura: The Counsel|The guerdon of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereof. But whosoever pardoneth  and amendeth, his wage is the affair of Allah. Lo! He loveth not wrong-doers. 
42|41|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong - for such, there  is no way (of blame) against them. 
42|42|ash-Shura: The Counsel|The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress mankind, and  wrongfully rebel in the earth. For such there is a painful doom. 
42|43|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And verily whoso is patient and forgiveth - lo! that, verily, is (of) the  steadfast heart of things. 
42|44|ash-Shura: The Counsel|He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no protecting friend after  Him. And thou (Muhammad) wilt see the evil-doers when they see the doom, (how)  they say: Is there any way of return ? 
42|45|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And thou wilt see them exposed to (the Fire), made humble by disgrace, and  looking with veiled eyes. And those who believe will say: Lo! the (eternal) losers are  they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! are not  the wrong-doers in perpetual torment ? 
42|46|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of Allah. He  whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no road. 
42|47|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Answer the call of your Lord before there cometh unto you from Allah a Day  which there is no averting. Ye have no refuge on that Day, nor have a ye any (power  of) refusal. 
42|48|ash-Shura: The Counsel|But if they are averse, We have not sent thee as a warder over them. Thine is  only to convey (the message). And lo! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us  he exulteth therefor. And if some evil striketh them because of that which their own  hands have sent before, then lo! man is an ingrate. 
42|49|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He  createth what He will. He bestoweth female (offspring) upon whom He will, and  bestoweth male (offspring) upon whom He will; 
42|50|ash-Shura: The Counsel|Or He mingleth them, males and females, and He maketh barren whom He  will. Lo! He is Knower, Powerful. 
42|51|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And it was not (vouchsafed) to any mortal that Allah should speak to him  unless (it be) by revelation or from behind a veil, or (that) He sendeth a messenger to  reveal what He will by His leave. Lo! He is Exalted, Wise. 
42|52|ash-Shura: The Counsel|And thus have We inspired in thee (Muhammad) a Spirit of Our command.  Thou knewest not what the Scripture was, nor what the Faith. But We have made it a  light whereby We guide whom We will of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost  guide unto a right path, 
42|53|ash-Shura: The Counsel|The path of Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. Do not all things reach Allah at last ? 
43|1|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Ha. Mim. 
43|2|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|By the Scripture which maketh plain, 
43|3|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Lo! We have appointed it a Lecture, in Arabic that haply ye may understand. 
43|4|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And Lo! in the Source of Decrees, which We possess, it is indeed sublime,  decisive. 
43|5|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk ? 
43|6|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|How many a prophet did We send among the men of old! 
43|7|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him. 
43|8|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of  the men of old hath gone (before them). 
43|9|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And if thou (Muhammad) ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth,  they will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them; 
43|10|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you therein,  that haply ye may find your way; 
43|11|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And Who sendeth down water from the sky in (due) measure, and We revive  a dead land therewith. Even so will ye be brought forth; 
43|12|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|He Who created all the pairs, and appointed for you ships and cattle  whereupon ye ride. 
43|13|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour  when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto  us, and we were not capable (of subduing them); 
43|14|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning. 
43|15|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere  ingrate. 
43|16|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you  with sons ? 
43|17|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent  One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage. 
43|18|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|(Liken they then to Allah) that which is bred up in outward show, and in  dispute cannot make itself plain ? 
43|19|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did  they witness their creation ? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be  questioned. 
43|20|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed, we should not have  worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess. 
43|21|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Or have We given them any scripture before (this Qur'an) so that they are  holding fast thereto ? 
43|22|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we  are guided by their footprints. 
43|23|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And even so We sent not a warner before thee (Muhammad) into any  township but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion,  and we are following their footprints. 
43|24|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|(And the warner) said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than  that ye found your fathers following ? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are  disbelievers. 
43|25|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the  rejecters! 
43|26|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of  what ye worship 
43|27|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me. 
43|28|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might  return. 
43|29|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life (only) till there should come  unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain. 
43|30|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic,  and lo! we are disbelievers therein. 
43|31|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the  two towns ? 
43|32|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Is it they who apportion thy Lord's mercy ? We have apportioned among  them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in  rank that some of them may take labour from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is  better than (the wealth) that they amass. 
43|33|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And were it not that mankind would have become one community, We might  well have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs of silver for  their houses and stairs (of silver) whereby to mount, 
43|34|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And for their houses doors (of silver) and couches of silver whereon to  recline, 
43|35|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And ornaments of gold. Yet all that would have been but a provision of the  life of the world. And the Hereafter with your Lord would have been for those who  keep from evil. 
43|36|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent, We assign  unto him a devil who becometh his comrade; 
43|37|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And lo! they surely turn them from the way of Allah, and yet they deem that  they are rightly guided; 
43|38|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Till, when he cometh unto Us, he saith (unto his comrade): Ah, would that  between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons - an evil comrade! 
43|39|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And it profiteth you not this day, because ye did wrong, that ye will be  sharers in the doom. 
43|40|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Canst thou (Muhammad) make the deaf to hear, or canst thou guide the blind  or him who is in error manifest ? 
43|41|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And if We take thee away, We surely shall take vengeance on them, 
43|42|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Or (if) We show thee that wherewith We threaten them; for lo! We have  complete command of them. 
43|43|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|So hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee. Lo! thou art on a right  path. 
43|44|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And lo! it is in truth a Reminder for thee and for thy folk; and ye will be  questioned. 
43|45|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before thee: Did We ever  appoint gods to be worshipped beside the Beneficent ? 
43|46|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations unto Pharaoh and his chiefs,  and he said: I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds. 
43|47|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|But when he brought them Our tokens, behold! they laughed at them. 
43|48|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And every token that We showed them was greater than its sister (token),  and We grasped them with the torment, that haply they might turn again. 
43|49|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they said: O wizard! Entreat thy Lord for us by the pact that He hath  made with thee. Lo! we verily will walk aright. 
43|50|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|But when We eased them of the torment, behold! they broke their word. 
43|51|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And Pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people saying: O  my people! Is not mine the sovereignty of Egypt and these rivers flowing under me ?  Can ye not then discern ? 
43|52|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable and can hardly make  (his meaning) plain! 
43|53|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon him, or angels sent along  with him ? 
43|54|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Thus he persuaded his people to make light (of Moses), and they obeyed  him. Lo! they were a wanton folk. 
43|55|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|So, when they angered Us, We punished them and drowned them every one. 
43|56|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And We made them a thing past, and an example for those after (them). 
43|57|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And when the son of Mary is quoted as an example, behold! the folk laugh  out, 
43|58|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And say: Are our gods better, or is he ? They raise not the objection save for  argument. Nay! but they are a contentious folk. 
43|59|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|He is nothing but a slave on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him a  pattern for the Children of Israel. 
43|60|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And had We willed We could have set among you angels to be viceroys in  the earth. 
43|61|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And lo! verily there is knowledge of the Hour. So doubt ye not concerning it,  but follow Me. This is the right path. 
43|62|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And let not Satan turn you aside. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 
43|63|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|When Jesus came with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), he said: I have  come unto you with wisdom, and to make plain some of that concerning which ye  differ. So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
43|64|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Lo! Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is a right  path. 
43|65|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|But the factions among them differed. Then woe unto those who do wrong  from the doom of a painful day. 
43|66|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Await they aught save the Hour, that it shall come upon them suddenly,  when they know not ? 
43|67|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Friends on that day will be foes one to another, save those who kept their  duty (to Allah). 
43|68|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|O My slaves! For you there is no fear this day, nor is it ye who grieve; 
43|69|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|(Ye) who believed Our revelations and were self-surrendered, 
43|70|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Enter the Garden, ye and your wives, to be made glad. 
43|71|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Therein are brought round for them trays of gold and goblets, and therein is  all that souls desire and eyes find sweet. And ye are immortal therein. 
43|72|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|This is the Garden which ye are made to inherit because of what ye used to  do. 
43|73|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Therein for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat. 
43|74|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Lo! the guilty are immortal in hell's torment. 
43|75|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|It is not relaxed for them, and they despair therein. 
43|76|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|We wronged them not, but they it was who did the wrong. 
43|77|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And they cry: O master! Let thy Lord make an end of us. He saith: Lo! here  ye must remain. 
43|78|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|We verily brought the Truth unto you, but ye were, most of you, averse to  the Truth. 
43|79|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Or do they determine any thing (against the Prophet) ? Lo! We (also) are  determining. 
43|80|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Or deem they that We cannot hear their secret thoughts and private  confidences ? Nay, but Our envoys, present with them, do record. 
43|81|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Say (O Muhammad): If the Beneficent One hath a son, then, I shall be first  among the worshippers. (But there is no son). 
43|82|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne,  from that which they ascribe (unto Him)! 
43|83|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|So let them flounder (in their talk) and play until they meet the Day which  they are promised. 
43|84|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And He it is Who in the heaven is God, and in the earth God. He is the Wise,  the Knower. 
43|85|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and  the earth and all that is between them, and with Whom is knowledge of the Hour, and  unto Whom ye will be returned. 
43|86|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And those unto whom they cry instead of Him possess no power of  intercession, saving him who beareth witness unto the Truth knowingly. 
43|87|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And if thou ask them who created them, they will surely say: Allah. How  then are they turned away ? 
43|88|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|And he saith: O my Lord! Lo! these are a folk who believe not. 
43|89|az-Zukhruf: The Embellishment|Then bear with them (O Muhammad) and say: Peace. But they will come to  know. 
44|1|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Ha. Mim. 
44|2|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|By the Scripture that maketh plain 
44|3|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - 
44|4|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Whereon every wise command is made clear 
44|5|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - 
44|6|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, 
44|7|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would  be sure. 
44|8|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and  Lord of your forefathers. 
44|9|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Nay, but they play in doubt. 
44|10|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce  visible smoke 
44|11|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. 
44|12|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|(Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are  believers. 
44|13|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain  (the Truth) had already come unto them, 
44|14|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a  madman ? 
44|15|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). 
44|16|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth  We shall punish. 
44|17|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them  a noble messenger, 
44|18|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger  unto you. 
44|19|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. 
44|20|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to  death. 
44|21|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. 
44|22|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. 
44|23|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be  followed, 
44|24|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. 
44|25|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, 
44|26|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And the cornlands and the goodly sites 
44|27|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And pleasant things wherein they took delight! 
44|28|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; 
44|29|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. 
44|30|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; 
44|31|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|(We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. 
44|32|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. 
44|33|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. 
44|34|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: 
44|35|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. 
44|36|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! 
44|37|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed  them, for surely they were guilty. 
44|38|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,  in play. 
44|39|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. 
44|40|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, 
44|41|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, 
44|42|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. 
44|43|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, 
44|44|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|The food of the sinner! 
44|45|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies 
44|46|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|As the seething of boiling water. 
44|47|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|(And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, 
44|48|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. 
44|49|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|(Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! 
44|50|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. 
44|51|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. 
44|52|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Amid gardens and watersprings, 
44|53|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. 
44|54|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely  eyes. 
44|55|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|They call therein for every fruit in safety. 
44|56|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them  from the doom of hell, 
44|57|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. 
44|58|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may  heed. 
44|59|ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke|Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting. 
45|1|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Ha. Mim. 
45|2|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. 
45|3|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Lo! in the heavens and the earth are portents for believers. 
45|4|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And in your creation, and all the beasts that He scattereth in the earth, are  portents for a folk whose faith is sure. 
45|5|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And the difference of night and day and the provision that Allah sendeth  down from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death, and the ordering  of the winds, are portents for a people who have sense. 
45|6|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad) with  truth. Then in what fact, after Allah and His portents, will they believe ? 
45|7|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Woe unto each sinful liar, 
45|8|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Who heareth the revelations of Allah recited unto him, and then continueth in  pride as though he heard them not. Give him tidings of a painful doom. 
45|9|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And when he knoweth aught of Our revelations he maketh it a jest. For such  there is a shameful doom. 
45|10|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Beyond them there is hell, and that which they have earned will naught avail  them, nor those whom they have chosen for protecting friends beside Allah. Theirs  will be an awful doom. 
45|11|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|This is guidance. And those who disbelieve the revelations of their Lord, for  them there is a painful doom of wrath. 
45|12|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Allah it is Who hath made the sea of service unto you that the ships may run  thereon by His command, and that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may  be thankful; 
45|13|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And hath made of service unto you whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth; it is all from Him. Lo! herein verily are portents for a  people who reflect. 
45|14|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah;  in order that He may requite folk what they used to earn. 
45|15|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Whoso doeth right, it is for his soul, and whoso doeth wrong, it is against it.  And afterward unto your Lord ye will be brought back. 
45|16|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And verily we gave the Children of Israel the Scripture and the Command  and the Prophethood, and provided them with good things and favoured them above  (all) peoples; 
45|17|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And gave them plain commandments. And they differed not until after the  knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves. Lo! thy Lord will  judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to  differ. 
45|18|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And now have We set thee (O Muhammad) on a clear road of (Our)  commandment; so follow it, and follow not the whims of those who know not. 
45|19|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Lo! they can avail thee naught against Allah. And lo! as for the wrong-doers,  some of them are friends of others; and Allah is the Friend of those who ward off  (evil). 
45|20|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|This is clear indication for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy for a folk  whose faith is sure. 
45|21|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Or do those who commit ill-deeds suppose that We shall make them as those  who believe and do good works, the same in life and death ? Bad is their judgment! 
45|22|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth, and that every  soul may be repaid what it hath earned. And they will not be wronged. 
45|23|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god, and Allah sendeth him  astray purposely, and sealeth up his hearing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a  covering ? Then who will lead him after Allah (hath condemned him) ? Will ye not  then heed ? 
45|24|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And they say: There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live,  and naught destroyeth us save time; when they have no knowledge whatsoever of (all)  that; they do but guess. 
45|25|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them their only argument is  that they say: Bring (back) our fathers. then, if ye are truthful. 
45|26|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Allah giveth life to you, then causeth you to  die, then gathereth you unto the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. But  most of mankind know not. 
45|27|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and  on the day when the Hour riseth, on that day those who follow falsehood will be lost. 
45|28|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And thou wilt see each nation crouching, each nation summoned to its  record. (And it will be said unto them): This day ye are requited what ye used to do. 
45|29|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|This Our Book pronounceth against you with truth. Lo! We have caused (all)  that ye did to be recorded. 
45|30|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Then, as for those who believed and did good works, their Lord will bring  them in unto His mercy. That is the evident triumph. 
45|31|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And as for those who disbelieved (it will be said unto them): Were not Our  revelations recited unto you ? But ye were scornful and became a guilty folk. 
45|32|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And when it was said: Lo! Allah's promise is the truth, and there is no doubt  of the Hour's coming, ye said: We know not what the Hour is. We deem it naught but  a conjecture, and we are by no means convinced. 
45|33|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And the evils of what they did will appear unto them, and that which they  used to deride will befall them. 
45|34|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And it will be said: This day We forget you, even as ye forgot the meeting of  this your day; and your habitation is the Fire, and there is none to help you. 
45|35|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|This, forasmuch as ye made the revelations of Allah a jest, and the life of the  world beguiled you. Therefor this day they come not forth from thence, nor can they  make amends. 
45|36|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|Then praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, the Lord  of the Worlds. 
45|37|al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling|And unto Him (alone) belongeth Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and  He is the Mighty, the Wise. 
46|1|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Ha. Mim. 
46|2|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty, the Wise. 
46|3|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save  with truth, and for a term appointed. But those who disbelieve turn away from that  whereof they are warned. 
46|4|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Have ye thought on all that ye invoke  beside Allah ? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or have they any portion  in the heavens ? Bring me a scripture before this (Scripture), or some vestige of  knowledge (in support of what ye say), if ye are truthful. 
46|5|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And who is further astray than those who, instead of Allah, pray unto such as  hear not their prayer until the Day of Resurrection, and are unconscious of their  prayer, 
46|6|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And when mankind are gathered (to the Judgment) will become enemies for  them, and will become deniers of having been worshipped. 
46|7|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve  say of the Truth when it reacheth them: This is mere magic. 
46|8|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Or say they: He hath invented it ? Say (O Muhammad): If I have invented it,  still ye have no power to support me against Allah. He is Best Aware of what ye say  among yourselves concerning it. He sufficeth for a witness between me and you. And  He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
46|9|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Say: I am no new thing among the messengers (of Allah), nor know I what  will be done with me or with you. I do but follow that which is inspired in me, and I  am but a plain warner. 
46|10|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye disbelieve therein, and a witness of  the Children of Israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath believed, and  ye are too proud (what plight is yours) ? Lo! Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk. 
46|11|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: If it had been (any)  good, they would not have been before us in attaining it. And since they will not be  guided by it, they say: This is an ancient lie; 
46|12|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|When before it there was the Scripture of Moses, an example and a mercy;  and this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language, that it may warn those who  do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous. 
46|13|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and thereafter walk aright, there shall  no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
46|14|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal therein, as a reward for  what they used to do. 
46|15|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents. His mother  beareth him with reluctance, and bringeth him forth with reluctance, and the bearing  of him and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full strength  and reacheth forty years, he saith: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for the  favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and that I may do right  acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed. Lo! I have  turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender (unto Thee). 
46|16|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook  their evil deeds. (They are) among the owners of the Garden. This is the true promise  which they were promised (in the world). 
46|17|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And whoso saith unto his parents: Fie upon you both! Do ye threaten me that  I shall be brought forth (again) when generations before me have passed away ? And  they twain cry unto Allah for help (and say): Woe unto thee! Believe! Lo! the promise  of Allah is true. But he saith: This is naught save fables of the men of old: 
46|18|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and  mankind which have passed away before them hath effect. Lo! they are the losers. 
46|19|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And for all there will be ranks from what they do, that He may pay them for  their deeds; and they will not be wronged. 
46|20|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (it will be  said): Ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort  therein. Now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because ye were  disdainful in the land without a right, and because ye used to transgress. 
46|21|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And make mention (O Muhammad) of the brother of A'ad when he warned  his folk among the wind-curved sandhills - and verily warners came and went before  and after him - saying: Serve none but Allah. Lo! I fear for you the doom of a  tremendous Day. 
46|22|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|They said: Hast come to turn us away from our gods ? Then bring upon us  that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the truthful. 
46|23|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|He said: The knowledge is with Allah only. I convey unto you that  wherewith I have been sent, but I see you are a folk that know not. 
46|24|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Then, when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they  said: Here is a cloud bringing us rain. Nay, but it is that which ye did seek to hasten, a  wind wherein is painful torment, 
46|25|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them  so that naught could be seen save their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. 
46|26|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not  empowered you, and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts; but their ears and  eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of Allah; and  what they used to mock befell them. 
46|27|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And verily We have destroyed townships round about you, and displayed  (for them) Our revelation, that haply they might return. 
46|28|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach  (unto Allah) not help them ? Nay, but they did fail them utterly. And (all) that was  their lie, and what they used to invent. 
46|29|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And when We inclined toward thee (Muhammad) certain of the jinn, who  wished to hear the Qur'an and, when they were in its presence, said: Give ear! and,  when it was finished, turned back to their people, warning. 
46|30|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a scripture which hath been  revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the truth and  a right road. 
46|31|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|O our people! respond to Allah's summoner and believe in Him. He will  forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom. 
46|32|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And whoso respondeth not to Allah's summoner he can nowise escape in the  earth, and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him. Such are in error manifest. 
46|33|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Have they not seen that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and  was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead ? Aye, He verily is  Able to do all things. 
46|34|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (they will  be asked): Is not this real ? They will say: Yea, by our Lord. He will say: Then taste  the doom for that ye disbelieved. 
46|35|al-Ahqaf: The Sandhills|Then have patience (O Muhammad) even as the stout of heart among the  messengers (of old) had patience, and seek not to hasten on (the doom) for them. On  the day when they see that which they are promised (it will seem to them) as though  they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be destroyed save  evil-living folk ? 
47|1|Muhammad: Muhammad|Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from the way of Allah, He rendereth  their actions vain. 
47|2|Muhammad: Muhammad|And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is  revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of  their ill-deeds and improveth their state. 
47|3|Muhammad: Muhammad|That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those  who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for  mankind. 
47|4|Muhammad: Muhammad|Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the  necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward  either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And  if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained)  that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way  of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain. 
47|5|Muhammad: Muhammad|He will guide them and improve their state, 
47|6|Muhammad: Muhammad|And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them. 
47|7|Muhammad: Muhammad|O ye who believe! If ye help Allah, He will help you and will make your  foothold firm. 
47|8|Muhammad: Muhammad|And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their  actions vain. 
47|9|Muhammad: Muhammad|That is because they are averse to that which Allah hath revealed, therefor  maketh He their actions fruitless. 
47|10|Muhammad: Muhammad|Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those who were before them ? Allah wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there  will be the like thereof. 
47|11|Muhammad: Muhammad|That is because Allah is patron of those who believe, and because the  disbelievers have no patron. 
47|12|Muhammad: Muhammad|Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens  underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this  life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation. 
47|13|Muhammad: Muhammad|And how many a township stronger than thy township (O Muhammad)  which hath cast thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper! 
47|14|Muhammad: Muhammad|Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil  that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts ? 
47|15|Muhammad: Muhammad|A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty (to Allah) are  promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the  flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear- run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their Lord. (Are  those who enjoy all this) like those who are immortal in the Fire and are given boiling  water to drink so that it teareth their bowels ? 
47|16|Muhammad: Muhammad|Among them are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad) till, when they  go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge:  What was that he said just now ? Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed, and  they follow their own lusts. 
47|17|Muhammad: Muhammad|While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth  them their protection (against evil). 
47|18|Muhammad: Muhammad|Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares ?  And the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon  them, can they take their warning ? 
47|19|Muhammad: Muhammad|So know (O Muhammad) that there is no God save Allah, and ask  forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. Allah knoweth  (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest. 
47|20|Muhammad: Muhammad|And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a  decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose  hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor  woe unto them! 
47|21|Muhammad: Muhammad|Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are  loyal to Allah it will be well for them. 
47|22|Muhammad: Muhammad|Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land  and sever your ties of kinship ? 
47|23|Muhammad: Muhammad|Such are they whom Allah curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh  blind their eyes. 
47|24|Muhammad: Muhammad|Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts ? 
47|25|Muhammad: Muhammad|Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them,  Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein. 
47|26|Muhammad: Muhammad|That is because they say unto those who hate what Allah hath revealed: We  will obey you in some matters; and Allah knoweth their secret talk. 
47|27|Muhammad: Muhammad|Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them, smiting their  faces and their backs! 
47|28|Muhammad: Muhammad|That will be because they followed that which angereth Allah, and hated that  which pleaseth Him. Therefor He hath made their actions vain. 
47|29|Muhammad: Muhammad|Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that Allah will not bring to  light their (secret) hates ? 
47|30|Muhammad: Muhammad|And if We would, We could show them unto thee (Muhammad) so that thou  shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden  of their talk. And Allah knoweth your deeds. 
47|31|Muhammad: Muhammad|And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard (for  the cause of Allah) and the steadfast, and till We test your record. 
47|32|Muhammad: Muhammad|Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and oppose the  messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not a  jot, and He will make their actions fruitless. 
47|33|Muhammad: Muhammad|O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and render not your  actions vain. 
47|34|Muhammad: Muhammad|Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and then die  disbelievers, Allah surely will not pardon them. 
47|35|Muhammad: Muhammad|So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye (will be) the uppermost, and  Allah is with you, and He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions. 
47|36|Muhammad: Muhammad|The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime. And if ye believe and ward  off (evil). He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your wordly wealth. 
47|37|Muhammad: Muhammad|If He should ask it of you and importune you, ye would hoard it, and He  would bring to light your (secret) hates. 
47|38|Muhammad: Muhammad|Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah, yet among you  there are some who hoard. And as for him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his  soul. And Allah is the Rich, and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will  exchange you for some other folk, and they will not be the likes of you. 
48|1|al-Fath: The Victory|Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory, 
48|2|al-Fath: The Victory|That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to  come, and may perfect His favour unto thee, and may guide thee on a right path, 
48|3|al-Fath: The Victory|And that Allah may help thee with strong help - 
48|4|al-Fath: The Victory|He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers  that they might add faith unto their faith. Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the  earth, and Allah is ever Knower, Wise - 
48|5|al-Fath: The Victory|That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and may remit from them their  evil deeds -  That, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph - 
48|6|al-Fath: The Victory|And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the  idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning  Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth against them and hath  cursed them, and hath made ready for them hell, a hapless journey's end. 
48|7|al-Fath: The Victory|Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty,  Wise. 
48|8|al-Fath: The Victory|Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) as a witness and a bearer of good  tidings and a warner, 
48|9|al-Fath: The Victory|That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger, and may honour  Him, and may revere Him, and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day. 
48|10|al-Fath: The Victory|Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance  only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his  oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant with  Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward. 
48|11|al-Fath: The Victory|Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our  possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They speak  with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail you aught  against Allah, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit ? Nay, but Allah is ever  Aware of what ye do. 
48|12|al-Fath: The Victory|Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return  to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did think an  evil thought, and ye were worthless folk. 
48|13|al-Fath: The Victory|And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger - Lo! We have  prepared a flame for disbelievers. 
48|14|al-Fath: The Victory|And Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgiveth  whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
48|15|al-Fath: The Victory|Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let  us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say (unto them, O  Muhammad): Ye shall not go with us. Thus hath Allah said beforehand. Then they  will say: Ye are envious of us. Nay, but they understand not, save a little. 
48|16|al-Fath: The Victory|Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be  called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and if ye  obey, Allah will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did turn away  before, He will punish you with a painful doom. 
48|17|al-Fath: The Victory|There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there  blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His  messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and  whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom. 
48|18|al-Fath: The Victory|Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto  thee beneath the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down peace  of reassurance on them, and hath rewarded them with a near victory; 
48|19|al-Fath: The Victory|And much booty that they will capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 
48|20|al-Fath: The Victory|Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this  in advance, and hath withheld men's hands from you, that it may be a token for the  believers, and that He may guide you on a right path. 
48|21|al-Fath: The Victory|And other (gain), which ye have not been able to achieve, Allah will  compass it, Allah is Able to do all things. 
48|22|al-Fath: The Victory|And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight, and  afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper. 
48|23|al-Fath: The Victory|It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find  for the law of Allah aught of power to change. 
48|24|al-Fath: The Victory|And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands from you, and hath withheld  your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after He had made you victors over  them. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
48|25|al-Fath: The Victory|These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of  Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for  believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them  under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah might bring into His  mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly  separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful  punishment. 
48|26|al-Fath: The Victory|When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of  the Age of Ignorance, then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His  messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for  they were worthy of it and meet for it. And Allah is Aware of all things. 
48|27|al-Fath: The Victory|Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall  indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure, (having your hair)  shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not, and hath given  you a near victory beforehand. 
48|28|al-Fath: The Victory|He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of  truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And Allah sufficeth as a  Witness. 
48|29|al-Fath: The Victory|Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against  the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them  bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His)  acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration.  Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn  that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk,  delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them.  Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness  and immense reward. 
49|1|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His  messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
49|2|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet,  nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be  rendered vain while ye perceive not. 
49|3|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah,  those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be  forgiveness and immense reward. 
49|4|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them  have no sense. 
49|5|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them, it had been  better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
49|6|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye smite  some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did. 
49|7|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|And know that the messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you  in much of the government, ye would surely be in trouble; but Allah hath endeared  the faith to you and hath beautified it in your hearts, and hath made disbelief and  lewdness and rebellion hateful unto you. Such are they who are the rightly guided. 
49|8|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|(It is) a bounty and a grace from Allah; and Allah is Knower, Wise. 
49|9|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between  them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which doeth  wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make peace between  them justly, and act equitably. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable. 
49|10|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|The believers are naught else than brothers. Therefore make peace between  your brethren and observe your duty to Allah that haply ye may obtain mercy. 
49|11|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they  (are), not let women (deride) women who may be better than they are; neither defame  one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. Bad is the name of lewdness after  faith. And whoso turneth not in repentance, such are evil-doers. 
49|12|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O ye who believe! Shun much suspicion; for lo! some suspicion is a crime.  And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of  his dead brother ? Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)! And keep your duty (to Allah).  Lo! Allah is Relenting, Merciful. 
49|13|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you  nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight  of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware. 
49|14|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|The wandering Arabs say: We believe. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Ye  believe not, but rather say "We submit," for the faith hath not yet entered into your  hearts. Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger, He will not withhold from you aught  of (the reward of) your deeds. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
49|15|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|The (true) believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger  and afterward doubt not, but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of  Allah. Such are the sincere. 
49|16|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Would ye teach Allah your religion, when  Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is Aware  of all things ? 
49|17|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|They make it a favour unto thee (Muhammad) that they have surrendered  (unto Him). Say: Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; but Allah doth confer a  favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith, if ye are earnest. 
49|18|al-Hujurat: The Chambers|Lo! Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is  Seer of what ye do. 
50|1|Qaf: Qaf|Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an, 
50|2|Qaf: Qaf|Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and  the disbelievers say: This is a strange thing: 
50|3|Qaf: Qaf|When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again) ?  That would be a far return! 
50|4|Qaf: Qaf|We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording  Book. 
50|5|Qaf: Qaf|Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they  are now in troubled case. 
50|6|Qaf: Qaf|Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed  it and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein ? 
50|7|Qaf: Qaf|And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and  have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon, 
50|8|Qaf: Qaf|A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave. 
50|9|Qaf: Qaf|And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth  unto gardens and the grain of crops, 
50|10|Qaf: Qaf|And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters, 
50|11|Qaf: Qaf|Provision (made) for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so  will be the resurrection of the dead. 
50|12|Qaf: Qaf|The folk of Noah denied (the truth) before them, and (so did) the dwellers at  Ar-Rass and (the tribe of) Thamud, 
50|13|Qaf: Qaf|And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, 
50|14|Qaf: Qaf|And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their  messengers, therefor My threat took effect. 
50|15|Qaf: Qaf|Were We then worn out by the first creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a  new creation. 
50|16|Qaf: Qaf|We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and  We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. 
50|17|Qaf: Qaf|When the two Receivers receive (him), seated on the right hand and on the  left, 
50|18|Qaf: Qaf|He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready. 
50|19|Qaf: Qaf|And the agony of death cometh in truth. (And it is said unto him): This is that  which thou wast wont to shun. 
50|20|Qaf: Qaf|And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day. 
50|21|Qaf: Qaf|And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness. 
50|22|Qaf: Qaf|(And unto the evil-doer it is said): Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now  We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day. 
50|23|Qaf: Qaf|And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready  (as testimony). 
50|24|Qaf: Qaf|(And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate, 
50|25|Qaf: Qaf|Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, 
50|26|Qaf: Qaf|Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the  dreadful doom. 
50|27|Qaf: Qaf|His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was  (himself) far gone in error. 
50|28|Qaf: Qaf|He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto  you the warning. 
50|29|Qaf: Qaf|The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a  tyrant unto the slaves. 
50|30|Qaf: Qaf|On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be  more to come ? 
50|31|Qaf: Qaf|And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer  distant. 
50|32|Qaf: Qaf|(And it is said): This is that which ye were promised.  (It is) for every  penitent and heedful one, 
50|33|Qaf: Qaf|Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart. 
50|34|Qaf: Qaf|Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality. 
50|35|Qaf: Qaf|There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us. 
50|36|Qaf: Qaf|And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier  than these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge  (when the judgment came) ? 
50|37|Qaf: Qaf|Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear with  full intelligence. 
50|38|Qaf: Qaf|And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between  them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us. 
50|39|Qaf: Qaf|Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of  thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun; 
50|40|Qaf: Qaf|And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the (prescribed)  prostrations. 
50|41|Qaf: Qaf|And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place, 
50|42|Qaf: Qaf|The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth. That is the day of  coming forth (from the graves). 
50|43|Qaf: Qaf|Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying. 
50|44|Qaf: Qaf|On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth (they  come). That is a gathering easy for Us (to make). 
50|45|Qaf: Qaf|We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise  a compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat. 
51|1|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|By those that winnow with a winnowing 
51|2|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And those that bear the burden (of the rain) 
51|3|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And those that glide with ease (upon the sea) 
51|4|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And those who distribute (blessings) by command, 
51|5|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true, 
51|6|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And lo! the judgment will indeed befall. 
51|7|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|By the heaven full of paths, 
51|8|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the truth). 
51|9|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|He is made to turn away from it who is (himself) averse. 
51|10|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Accursed be the conjecturers 
51|11|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Who are careless in an abyss! 
51|12|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ? 
51|13|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|(It is) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire, 
51|14|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|(And it will be said unto them): Taste your torment (which ye inflicted). This  is what ye sought to hasten. 
51|15|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings, 
51|16|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers  of good; 
51|17|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|They used to sleep but little of the night, 
51|18|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness, 
51|19|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share. 
51|20|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure. 
51|21|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see ? 
51|22|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised; 
51|23|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as (it is  true) that ye speak. 
51|24|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ? 
51|25|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! (and  thought): Folk unknown (to me). 
51|26|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf; 
51|27|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat ? 
51|28|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings  of (the birth of) a wise son. 
51|29|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A  barren old woman! 
51|30|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower. 
51|31|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|(Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is your errand, O ye sent (from Allah)  ? 
51|32|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk, 
51|33|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|That we may send upon them stones of clay, 
51|34|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction of) the wanton. 
51|35|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Then we brought forth such believers as were there. 
51|36|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to Allah). 
51|37|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom. 
51|38|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in Moses (too, there is a portent) when We sent him unto Pharaoh with  clear warrant, 
51|39|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|But he withdrew (confiding) in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman. 
51|40|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was  reprobate. 
51|41|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind  against them. 
51|42|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust. 
51|43|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take  your ease awhile. 
51|44|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook  them even while they gazed; 
51|45|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves. 
51|46|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk. 
51|47|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent  (thereof). 
51|48|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)! 
51|49|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect. 
51|50|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him. 
51|51|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you  from Him. 
51|52|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A  wizard or a madman! 
51|53|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another ? Nay,  but they are froward folk. 
51|54|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise  blameworthy, 
51|55|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And warn, for warning profiteth believers. 
51|56|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me. 
51|57|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me. 
51|58|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might. 
51|59|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil  day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that  day). 
51|60|adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers|And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are  promised. 
52|1|at-Tur: The Mountain|By the Mount, 
52|2|at-Tur: The Mountain|And a Scripture inscribed 
52|3|at-Tur: The Mountain|On fine parchment unrolled, 
52|4|at-Tur: The Mountain|And the House frequented, 
52|5|at-Tur: The Mountain|And the roof exalted, 
52|6|at-Tur: The Mountain|And the sea kept filled, 
52|7|at-Tur: The Mountain|Lo! the doom of thy Lord will surely come to pass; 
52|8|at-Tur: The Mountain|There is none that can ward it off. 
52|9|at-Tur: The Mountain|On the day when the heaven will heave with (awful) heaving, 
52|10|at-Tur: The Mountain|And the mountains move away with (awful) movement, 
52|11|at-Tur: The Mountain|Then woe that day unto the deniers 
52|12|at-Tur: The Mountain|Who play in talk of grave matters; 
52|13|at-Tur: The Mountain|The day when they are thrust with a (disdainful) thrust, into the fire of hell 
52|14|at-Tur: The Mountain|(And it is said unto them): This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny. 
52|15|at-Tur: The Mountain|Is this magic, or do ye not see ? 
52|16|at-Tur: The Mountain|Endure the heat thereof, and whether ye are patient of it or impatient of it is  all one for you. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do. 
52|17|at-Tur: The Mountain|Lo! those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight, 
52|18|at-Tur: The Mountain|Happy because of what their Lord hath given them, and (because) their Lord  hath warded off from them the torment of hell-fire. 
52|19|at-Tur: The Mountain|(And it is said unto them): Eat and drink in health (as a reward) for what ye  used to do, 
52|20|at-Tur: The Mountain|Reclining on ranged couches. And we wed them unto fair ones with wide,  lovely eyes. 
52|21|at-Tur: The Mountain|And they who believe and whose seed follow them in faith, We cause their  seed to join them (there), and We deprive them of nought of their (life's) work. Every  man is a pledge for that which he hath earned. 
52|22|at-Tur: The Mountain|And We provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire. 
52|23|at-Tur: The Mountain|There they pass from hand to hand a cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause  of sin. 
52|24|at-Tur: The Mountain|And there go round, waiting on them menservants of their own, as they were  hidden pearls. 
52|25|at-Tur: The Mountain|And some of them draw near unto others, questioning, 
52|26|at-Tur: The Mountain|Saying: Lo! of old, when we were with our families, we were ever anxious; 
52|27|at-Tur: The Mountain|But Allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment  of the breath of Fire. 
52|28|at-Tur: The Mountain|Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful. 
52|29|at-Tur: The Mountain|Therefor warn (men, O Muhammad). By the grace of Allah thou art neither  soothsayer nor madman. 
52|30|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or say they: (he is) a poet, (one) for whom we may expect the accident of  time ? 
52|31|at-Tur: The Mountain|Say (unto them): Except (your fill)! Lo! I am with you among the expectant. 
52|32|at-Tur: The Mountain|Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk ? 
52|33|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or say they: He hath invented it ? Nay, but they will not believe! 
52|34|at-Tur: The Mountain|Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful. 
52|35|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or were they created out of naught ? Or are they the creators ? 
52|36|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or did they create the heavens and the earth ? Nay, but they are sure of  nothing! 
52|37|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord ? Or have they been given charge  (thereof) ? 
52|38|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear  (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! 
52|39|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or hath He daughters whereas ye have sons ? 
52|40|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt  ? 
52|41|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down ? 
52|42|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger) ? But those who disbelieve, they are  the ensnared! 
52|43|at-Tur: The Mountain|Or have they any god beside Allah ? Glorified be Allah from all that they  ascribe as partner (unto Him)! 
52|44|at-Tur: The Mountain|And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A  heap of clouds. 
52|45|at-Tur: The Mountain|Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will  be thunder-stricken, 
52|46|at-Tur: The Mountain|A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. 
52|47|at-Tur: The Mountain|And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But  most of them know not. 
52|48|at-Tur: The Mountain|So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in  Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, 
52|49|at-Tur: The Mountain|And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. 
53|1|an-Najm: The Star|By the Star when it setteth, 
53|2|an-Najm: The Star|Your comrade erreth not, nor is deceived; 
53|3|an-Najm: The Star|Nor doth he speak of (his own) desire. 
53|4|an-Najm: The Star|It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired, 
53|5|an-Najm: The Star|Which one of mighty powers hath taught him, 
53|6|an-Najm: The Star|One vigorous; and he grew clear to view 
53|7|an-Najm: The Star|When he was on the uppermost horizon. 
53|8|an-Najm: The Star|Then he drew nigh and came down 
53|9|an-Najm: The Star|Till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer, 
53|10|an-Najm: The Star|And He revealed unto His slave that which He revealed. 
53|11|an-Najm: The Star|The heart lied not (in seeing) what it saw. 
53|12|an-Najm: The Star|Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth ? 
53|13|an-Najm: The Star|And verily he saw him yet another time 
53|14|an-Najm: The Star|By the lote-tree of the utmost boundary, 
53|15|an-Najm: The Star|Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode. 
53|16|an-Najm: The Star|When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote-tree, 
53|17|an-Najm: The Star|The eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold. 
53|18|an-Najm: The Star|Verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord. 
53|19|an-Najm: The Star|Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza 
53|20|an-Najm: The Star|And Manat, the third, the other ? 
53|21|an-Najm: The Star|Are yours the males and His the females ? 
53|22|an-Najm: The Star|That indeed were an unfair division! 
53|23|an-Najm: The Star|They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which  Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they)  themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them. 
53|24|an-Najm: The Star|Or shall man have what he coveteth ? 
53|25|an-Najm: The Star|But unto Allah belongeth the after (life), and the former. 
53|26|an-Najm: The Star|And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught  save after Allah giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth. 
53|27|an-Najm: The Star|Lo! it is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter who name the angels with the  names of females. 
53|28|an-Najm: The Star|And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a  guess can never take the place of the truth. 
53|29|an-Najm: The Star|Then withdraw (O Muhammad) from him who fleeth from Our remembrance  and desireth but the life of the world. 
53|30|an-Najm: The Star|Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who  strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right. 
53|31|an-Najm: The Star|And unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in  the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done, and  reward those who do good with goodness. 
53|32|an-Najm: The Star|Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled  offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the  time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of  your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him  who wardeth off (evil). 
53|33|an-Najm: The Star|Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away, 
53|34|an-Najm: The Star|And gave a little, then was grudging ? 
53|35|an-Najm: The Star|Hath he knowledge of the Unseen so that he seeth ? 
53|36|an-Najm: The Star|Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses 
53|37|an-Najm: The Star|And Abraham who paid his debt: 
53|38|an-Najm: The Star|That no laden one shall bear another's load, 
53|39|an-Najm: The Star|And that man hath only that for which he maketh effort, 
53|40|an-Najm: The Star|And that his effort will be seen. 
53|41|an-Najm: The Star|And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment; 
53|42|an-Najm: The Star|And that thy Lord, He is the goal; 
53|43|an-Najm: The Star|And that He it is who maketh laugh, and maketh weep, 
53|44|an-Najm: The Star|And that He it is Who giveth death and giveth life; 
53|45|an-Najm: The Star|And that He createth the two spouses, the male and the female, 
53|46|an-Najm: The Star|From a drop (of seed) when it is poured forth; 
53|47|an-Najm: The Star|And that He hath ordained the second bringing forth; 
53|48|an-Najm: The Star|And that He it is Who enricheth and contenteth; 
53|49|an-Najm: The Star|And that He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius; 
53|50|an-Najm: The Star|And that He destroyed the former (tribe of) A'ad, 
53|51|an-Najm: The Star|And (the tribe of) Thamud He spared not; 
53|52|an-Najm: The Star|And the folk of Noah aforetime, Lo! they were more unjust and more  rebellious; 
53|53|an-Najm: The Star|And Al-Mu'tafikah He destroyed 
53|54|an-Najm: The Star|So that there covered them that which did cover. 
53|55|an-Najm: The Star|Concerning which then, of the bounties of thy Lord, canst thou dispute ? 
53|56|an-Najm: The Star|This is a warner of the warners of old. 
53|57|an-Najm: The Star|The threatened Hour is nigh. 
53|58|an-Najm: The Star|None beside Allah can disclose it. 
53|59|an-Najm: The Star|Marvel ye then at this statement, 
53|60|an-Najm: The Star|And laugh and not weep, 
53|61|an-Najm: The Star|While ye amuse yourselves ? 
53|62|an-Najm: The Star|Rather prostrate yourselves before Allah and serve Him. 
54|1|al-Qamar: The Moon|The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. 
54|2|al-Qamar: The Moon|And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion. 
54|3|al-Qamar: The Moon|They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will  come to a decision 
54|4|al-Qamar: The Moon|And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should  deter, 
54|5|al-Qamar: The Moon|Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not. 
54|6|al-Qamar: The Moon|So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner  summoneth unto a painful thing. 
54|7|al-Qamar: The Moon|With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts  spread abroad, 
54|8|al-Qamar: The Moon|Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. 
54|9|al-Qamar: The Moon|The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A  madman; and he was repulsed. 
54|10|al-Qamar: The Moon|So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. 
54|11|al-Qamar: The Moon|Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water 
54|12|al-Qamar: The Moon|And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a  predestined purpose. 
54|13|al-Qamar: The Moon|And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, 
54|14|al-Qamar: The Moon|That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was  rejected. 
54|15|al-Qamar: The Moon|And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ? 
54|16|al-Qamar: The Moon|Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
54|17|al-Qamar: The Moon|And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
54|18|al-Qamar: The Moon|(The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My  punishment after My warnings. 
54|19|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, 
54|20|al-Qamar: The Moon|Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. 
54|21|al-Qamar: The Moon|Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
54|22|al-Qamar: The Moon|And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
54|23|al-Qamar: The Moon|(The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings 
54|24|al-Qamar: The Moon|For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ?  Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. 
54|25|al-Qamar: The Moon|Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is  a rash liar. 
54|26|al-Qamar: The Moon|(Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash  liar. 
54|27|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have  patience; 
54|28|al-Qamar: The Moon|And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them.  Every drinking will be witnessed. 
54|29|al-Qamar: The Moon|But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). 
54|30|al-Qamar: The Moon|Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! 
54|31|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs  (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. 
54|32|al-Qamar: The Moon|And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
54|33|al-Qamar: The Moon|The folk of Lot rejected warnings. 
54|34|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom  We rescued in the last watch of the night, 
54|35|al-Qamar: The Moon|As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. 
54|36|al-Qamar: The Moon|And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the  warnings. 
54|37|al-Qamar: The Moon|They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their  eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! 
54|38|al-Qamar: The Moon|And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. 
54|39|al-Qamar: The Moon|Now taste My punishment after My warnings! 
54|40|al-Qamar: The Moon|And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? 
54|41|al-Qamar: The Moon|And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh 
54|42|al-Qamar: The Moon|Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the  grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. 
54|43|al-Qamar: The Moon|Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the  scriptures ? 
54|44|al-Qamar: The Moon|Or say they: We are a host victorious ? 
54|45|al-Qamar: The Moon|The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. 
54|46|al-Qamar: The Moon|Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be  more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure). 
54|47|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! the guilty are in error and madness. 
54|48|al-Qamar: The Moon|On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said  unto them): Feel the touch of hell. 
54|49|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! We have created every thing by measure. 
54|50|al-Qamar: The Moon|And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an  eye. 
54|51|al-Qamar: The Moon|And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that  remembereth ? 
54|52|al-Qamar: The Moon|And every thing they did is in the scriptures, 
54|53|al-Qamar: The Moon|And every small and great thing is recorded. 
54|54|al-Qamar: The Moon|Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers, 
54|55|al-Qamar: The Moon|Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King. 
55|1|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|The Beneficent 
55|2|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Hath made known the Qur'an. 
55|3|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|He hath created man. 
55|4|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|He hath taught him utterance. 
55|5|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|The sun and the moon are made punctual. 
55|6|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|The stars and the trees adore. 
55|7|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|And the sky He hath uplifted; and He hath set the measure, 
55|8|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|That ye exceed not the measure, 
55|9|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|But observe the measure strictly, nor fall short thereof. 
55|10|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|And the earth hath He appointed for (His) creatures, 
55|11|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein are fruit and sheathed palm-trees, 
55|12|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Husked grain and scented herb. 
55|13|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|14|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|He created man of clay like the potter's, 
55|15|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|And the jinn did He create of smokeless fire. 
55|16|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|17|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Lord of the two Easts, and Lord of the two Wests! 
55|18|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|19|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|He hath loosed the two seas. They meet. 
55|20|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). 
55|21|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|22|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. 
55|23|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|24|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. 
55|25|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|26|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Everyone that is thereon will pass away; 
55|27|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. 
55|28|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|29|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He  exerciseth (universal) power. 
55|30|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|31|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). 
55|32|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|33|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the  heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with  (Our) sanction. 
55|34|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|35|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye  will not escape. 
55|36|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|37|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - 
55|38|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 
55|39|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. 
55|40|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|41|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks  and the feet. 
55|42|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|43|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|This is hell which the guilty deny. 
55|44|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. 
55|45|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|46|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. 
55|47|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|48|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Of spreading branches. 
55|49|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|50|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein are two fountains flowing. 
55|51|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|52|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. 
55|53|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|54|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens  near to hand. 
55|55|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|56|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have  touched before them. 
55|57|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|58|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|(In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. 
55|59|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|60|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness ? 
55|61|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|62|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|And beside them are two other gardens, 
55|63|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|64|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Dark green with foliage. 
55|65|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|66|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein are two abundant springs. 
55|67|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|68|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. 
55|69|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|70|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - 
55|71|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 
55|72|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - 
55|73|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 
55|74|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - 
55|75|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|76|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. 
55|77|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 
55|78|ar-Rahman: The Merciful|Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious! 
56|1|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|When the event befalleth - 
56|2|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|There is no denying that it will befall - 
56|3|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Abasing (some), exalting (others); 
56|4|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|When the earth is shaken with a shock 
56|5|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And the hills are ground to powder 
56|6|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|So that they become a scattered dust, 
56|7|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And ye will be three kinds: 
56|8|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|(First) those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? 
56|9|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And (then) those on the left hand; what of those on the left hand ? 
56|10|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And the foremost in the race, the foremost in the race: 
56|11|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Those are they who will be brought nigh 
56|12|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|In gardens of delight; 
56|13|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|A multitude of those of old 
56|14|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And a few of those of later time. 
56|15|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|On lined couches, 
56|16|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Reclining therein face to face. 
56|17|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|There wait on them immortal youths 
56|18|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|With bowls and ewers and a cup from a pure spring 
56|19|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness, 
56|20|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And fruit that they prefer 
56|21|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And flesh of fowls that they desire. 
56|22|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And (there are) fair ones with wide, lovely eyes, 
56|23|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Like unto hidden pearls, 
56|24|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Reward for what they used to do. 
56|25|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|There hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination 
56|26|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|(Naught) but the saying: Peace, (and again) Peace. 
56|27|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? 
56|28|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Among thornless lote-trees 
56|29|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And clustered plantains, 
56|30|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And spreading shade, 
56|31|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And water gushing, 
56|32|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And fruit in plenty 
56|33|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden, 
56|34|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And raised couches; 
56|35|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Lo! We have created them a (new) creation 
56|36|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And made them virgins, 
56|37|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Lovers, friends, 
56|38|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|For those on the right hand; 
56|39|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|A multitude of those of old 
56|40|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And a multitude of those of later time. 
56|41|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And those on the left hand: What of those on the left hand ? 
56|42|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|In scorching wind and scalding water 
56|43|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And shadow of black smoke, 
56|44|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Neither cool nor refreshing. 
56|45|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Lo! heretofore they were effete with luxury 
56|46|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And used to persist in the awful sin. 
56|47|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And they used to say: When we are dead and have become dust and bones,  shall we then, forsooth, be raised again, 
56|48|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And also our forefathers ? 
56|49|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! those of old and those of later time 
56|50|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day. 
56|51|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers, 
56|52|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Ye verily will eat of a tree called Zaqqum 
56|53|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And will fill your bellies therewith; 
56|54|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And thereon ye will drink of boiling water, 
56|55|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Drinking even as the camel drinketh. 
56|56|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment. 
56|57|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|We created you. Will ye then admit the truth ? 
56|58|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Have ye seen that which ye emit ? 
56|59|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Do ye create it or are We the Creator ? 
56|60|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|We mete out death among you, and We are not to be outrun, 
56|61|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|That We may transfigure you and make you what ye know not. 
56|62|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And verily ye know the first creation. Why, then, do ye not reflect ? 
56|63|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Have ye seen that which ye cultivate ? 
56|64|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Is it ye who foster it, or are We the Fosterer ? 
56|65|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|If We willed, We verily could make it chaff, then would ye cease not to  exclaim: 
56|66|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Lo! we are laden with debt! 
56|67|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Nay, but we are deprived! 
56|68|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Have ye observed the water which ye drink ? 
56|69|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud, or are We the Shedder ? 
56|70|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|If We willed We verily could make it bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks ? 
56|71|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Have ye observed the fire which ye strike out; 
56|72|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow, or were We the grower ? 
56|73|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|We, even We, appointed it a memorial and a comfort for the dwellers in the  wilderness. 
56|74|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Therefor (O Muhammad), praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous. 
56|75|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Nay, I swear by the places of the stars - 
56|76|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And lo! that verily is a tremendous oath, if ye but knew - 
56|77|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|That (this) is indeed a noble Qur'an 
56|78|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|In a Book kept hidden 
56|79|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Which none toucheth save the purified, 
56|80|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. 
56|81|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Is it this Statement that ye scorn, 
56|82|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And make denial thereof your livelihood ? 
56|83|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Why, then, when (the soul) cometh up to the throat (of the dying) 
56|84|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And ye are at that moment looking 
56|85|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|- And We are nearer unto him than ye are, but ye see not - 
56|86|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Why then, if ye are not in bondage (unto Us), 
56|87|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Do ye not force it back, if ye are truthful ? 
56|88|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Thus if he is of those brought nigh, 
56|89|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Then breath of life, and plenty, and a Garden of delight. 
56|90|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And if he is of those on the right hand, 
56|91|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Then (the greeting) "Peace be unto thee" from those on the right hand. 
56|92|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|But if he is of the rejecters, the erring, 
56|93|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Then the welcome will be boiling water 
56|94|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|And roasting at hell-fire. 
56|95|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Lo! this is certain truth. 
56|96|al-Waqi`ah: That Which is Coming|Therefor (O Muhammad) praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous. 
57|1|al-Hadid: The Iron|All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Allah; and He is the Mighty,  the Wise. 
57|2|al-Hadid: The Iron|His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He quickeneth and He  giveth death; and He is Able to do all things. 
57|3|al-Hadid: The Iron|He is the First and the Last, and the Outward and the Inward; and He is  Knower of all things. 
57|4|al-Hadid: The Iron|He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days; then He mounted  the Throne. He knoweth all that entereth the earth and all that emergeth therefrom and  all that cometh down from the sky and all that ascendeth therein; and He is with you  wheresoever ye may be. And Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
57|5|al-Hadid: The Iron|His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah (all)  things are brought back. 
57|6|al-Hadid: The Iron|He causeth the night to pass into the day, and He causeth the day to pass into  the night, and He is knower of all that is in the breasts. 
57|7|al-Hadid: The Iron|Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend of that whereof He hath  made you trustees; and such of you as believe and spend (aright), theirs will be a great  reward. 
57|8|al-Hadid: The Iron|What aileth you that ye believe not in Allah, when the messenger calleth you  to believe in your Lord, and He hath already made a covenant with you, if ye are  believers ? 
57|9|al-Hadid: The Iron|He it is Who sendeth down clear revelations unto His slave, that He may  bring you forth from darkness unto light; and lo! for you, Allah is Full of Pity,  Merciful. 
57|10|al-Hadid: The Iron|And what aileth you that ye spend not in the way of Allah when unto Allah  belongeth the inheritance of the heavens and the earth ? Those who spent and fought  before the victory are not upon a level (with the rest of you). Such are greater in rank  than those who spent and fought afterwards. Unto each hath Allah promised good.  And Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
57|11|al-Hadid: The Iron|Who is he that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, that He may double it for  him and his may be a rich reward ? 
57|12|al-Hadid: The Iron|On the day when thou (Muhammad) wilt see the believers, men and women,  their light shining forth before them and on their right hands, (and wilt hear it said  unto them): Glad news for you this day: Gardens underneath which rivers flow,  wherein ye are immortal. That is the supreme triumph. 
57|13|al-Hadid: The Iron|On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say  unto those who believe: Look on us that we may borrow from your light! it will be  said: Go back and seek for light! Then there will separate them a wall wherein is a  gate, the inner side whereof containeth mercy, while the outer side thereof is toward  the doom. 
57|14|al-Hadid: The Iron|They will cry unto them (saying): Were we not with you ? They will say:  Yea, verily; but ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires  beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived you  concerning Allah; 
57|15|al-Hadid: The Iron|So this day no ransom can be taken from you nor from those who  disbelieved. Your home is the Fire; that is your patron, and a hapless journey's end. 
57|16|al-Hadid: The Iron|Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe to submit to Allah's  reminder and to the truth which is revealed, that they become not as those who  received the scripture of old but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts  were hardened, and many of them are evil-livers. 
57|17|al-Hadid: The Iron|Know that Allah quickeneth the earth after its death. We have made clear  Our revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. 
57|18|al-Hadid: The Iron|Lo! those who give alms, both men and women, and lend unto Allah a  goodly loan, it will be doubled for them, and theirs will be a rich reward. 
57|19|al-Hadid: The Iron|And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, they are the loyal, and  the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light; while as for  those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell-fire. 
57|20|al-Hadid: The Iron|Know that the life of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry, and  boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children; as the likeness of  vegetation after rain, whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman, but afterward  it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow, then it becometh straw. And in the  Hereafter there is grievous punishment, and (also) forgiveness from Allah and His  good pleasure, whereas the life of the world is but matter of illusion. 
57|21|al-Hadid: The Iron|Race one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whereof  the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, which is in store for those  who believe in Allah and His messengers. Such is the bounty of Allah, which He  bestoweth upon whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
57|22|al-Hadid: The Iron|Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in a Book  before we bring it into being - Lo! that is easy for Allah - 
57|23|al-Hadid: The Iron|That ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you, nor yet exult  because of that which hath been given. Allah loveth not all prideful boasters, 
57|24|al-Hadid: The Iron|Who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice. And whosoever turneth  away, still Allah is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. 
57|25|al-Hadid: The Iron|We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the  Scripture and the Balance, that mankind may observe right measure; and He revealed  iron, wherein is mighty power and (many) uses for mankind, and that Allah may  know him who helpeth Him and His messengers, though unseen. Lo! Allah is Strong,  Almighty. 
57|26|al-Hadid: The Iron|And We verily sent Noah and Abraham and placed the prophethood and the  scripture among their seed, and among them there is he who goeth right, but many of  them are evil-livers. 
57|27|al-Hadid: The Iron|Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused  Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion and  mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But monasticism they invented - We  ordained it not for them - only seeking Allah's pleasure, and they observed it not with  right observance. So We give those of them who believe their reward, but many of  them are evil-livers. 
57|28|al-Hadid: The Iron|O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah and put faith in His  messenger. He will give you twofold of His mercy and will appoint for you a light  wherein ye shall walk, and will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful; 
57|29|al-Hadid: The Iron|That the People of the Scripture may know that they control naught of the  bounty of Allah, but that the bounty is in Allah's hand to give to whom He will. And  Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
58|1|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Allah hath heard the saying of her that disputeth with thee (Muhammad)  concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah. And Allah heareth your  colloquy. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
58|2|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers) -  They are not their mothers; none are their mothers except those who gave them birth -  they indeed utter an ill word and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
58|3|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers) and  afterward would go back on that which they have said, (the penalty) in that case (is)  the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this ye are exhorted; and  Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
58|4|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|And he who findeth not (the wherewithal), let him fast for two successive  months before they touch one another; and for him who is unable to do so (the  penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones. This, that ye may put trust in Allah and  His messenger. Such are the limits (imposed by Allah); and for disbelievers is a  painful doom. 
58|5|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger will be abased even as those  before them were abased; and We have sent down clear tokens, and for disbelievers is  a shameful doom 
58|6|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|On the day when Allah will raise them all together and inform them of what  they did. Allah hath kept account of it while they forgot it. And Allah is Witness over  all things. 
58|7|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Hast thou not seen that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is  in the earth ? There is no secret conference of three but He is their fourth, nor of five  but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with them wheresoever  they may be; and afterward, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what  they did. Lo! Allah is Knower of all things. 
58|8|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Hast thou not observed those who were forbidden conspiracy and afterward  returned to that which they had been forbidden, and (now) conspire together for crime  and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger ? And when they come unto  thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not, and say within  themselves: Why should Allah punish us for what we say ? Hell will suffice them;  they will feel the heat thereof - a hapless journey's end! 
58|9|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|O ye who believe! When ye conspire together, conspire not together for  crime and wrongdoing and disobedience toward the messenger, but conspire together  for righteousness and piety, and keep your duty toward Allah, unto whom ye will be  gathered. 
58|10|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Lo! Conspiracy is only of the devil, that he may vex those who believe; but  he can harm them not at all unless by Allah's leave. In Allah let believers put their  trust. 
58|11|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|O ye who believe! when it is said unto you, Make room! in assemblies, then  make room; Allah will make way for you (hereafter). And when it is said, Come up  higher! go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe among you, and those who  have knowledge, to high ranks. Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
58|12|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|O ye who believe! When ye hold conference with the messenger, offer an  alms before your conference. That is better and purer for you. But if ye cannot find  (the wherewithal) then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
58|13|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Fear ye to offer alms before your conference ? Then, when ye do it not and  Allah hath forgiven you, establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey Allah and  His messenger. And Allah is Aware of what ye do. 
58|14|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is  wroth ? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear a false oath knowingly. 
58|15|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Allah hath prepared for them a dreadful doom. Evil indeed is that which they  are wont to do. 
58|16|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|They make a shelter of their oaths and turn (men) from the way of Allah; so  theirs will be a shameful doom. 
58|17|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Their wealth and their children will avail them naught against Allah. Such  are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. 
58|18|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|On the day when Allah will raise them all together, then will they swear unto  Him as they (now) swear unto you, and they will fancy that they have some standing.  Lo! is it not they who are the liars ? 
58|19|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|The devil hath engrossed them and so hath caused them to forget  remembrance of Allah. They are the devil's party. Lo! is it not the devil's party who  will be the losers ? 
58|20|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Lo! those who oppose Allah and His messenger, they will be among the  lowest. 
58|21|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers. Lo!  Allah is Strong, Almighty. 
58|22|al-Mujadilah: She Who Pleaded|Thou wilt not find folk who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those  who oppose Allah and His messenger, even though they be their fathers or their sons  or their brethren or their clan. As for such, He hath written faith upon their hearts and  hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him, and He will bring them into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. Allah is well pleased with  them, and they are well pleased with Him. They are Allah's party. Lo! is it not Allah's  party who are the successful ? 
59|1|al-Hashr: The Exile|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and He is  the Mighty, the Wise. 
59|2|al-Hashr: The Exile|He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who  disbelieved to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they  would go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from  Allah.  But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast terror  in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of  the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes! 
59|3|al-Hashr: The Exile|And if Allah had not decreed migration for them, He verily would have  punished them in the world, and theirs in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire. 
59|4|al-Hashr: The Exile|That is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger; and whoso is  opposed to Allah, (for him) verily Allah is stern in reprisal. 
59|5|al-Hashr: The Exile|Whatsoever palm-trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by  Allah's leave, in order that He might confound the evil-livers. 
59|6|al-Hashr: The Exile|And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged  not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger  lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. 
59|7|al-Hashr: The Exile|That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the  townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans  and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich  among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he  forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in  reprisal. 
59|8|al-Hashr: The Exile|And (it is) for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes  and their belongings, who seek bounty from Allah and help Allah and His messenger.  They are the loyal. 
59|9|al-Hashr: The Exile|Those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who flee  unto them for refuge, and find in their breasts no need for that which hath been given  them, but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot.  And whoso is saved from his own avarice - such are they who are successful. 
59|10|al-Hashr: The Exile|And those who came (into the faith) after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us  and our brethren who were before us in the faith, and place not in our hearts any  rancour toward those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Merciful. 
59|11|al-Hashr: The Exile|Hast thou not observed those who are hypocrites, (how) they tell their  brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture: If ye are driven out, we  surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you, and if ye are  attacked we verily will help you. And Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. 
59|12|al-Hashr: The Exile|(For) indeed if they are driven out they go not out with them, and indeed if  they are attacked they help them not, and indeed if they had helped them they would  have turned and fled, and then they would not have been victorious. 
59|13|al-Hashr: The Exile|Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah. That is because they  are a folk who understand not. 
59|14|al-Hashr: The Exile|They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from  behind walls. Their adversity among themselves is very great. Ye think of them as a  whole whereas their hearts are divers. That is because they are a folk who have no  sense. 
59|15|al-Hashr: The Exile|On the likeness of those (who suffered) a short time before them, they taste  the ill-effects of their own conduct, and theirs is painful punishment. 
59|16|al-Hashr: The Exile|(And the hypocrites are) on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to  disbelieve, then, when he disbelieveth saith: Lo! I am quit of thee. Lo! I fear Allah,  the Lord of the Worlds. 
59|17|al-Hashr: The Exile|And the consequence for both will be that they are in the Fire, therein  abiding. Such is the reward of evil-doers. 
59|18|al-Hashr: The Exile|O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah. And let every soul look to  that which it sendeth on before for the morrow. And observe your duty to Allah. Lo!  Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
59|19|al-Hashr: The Exile|And be not ye as those who forgot Allah, therefor He caused them to forget  their souls. Such are the evil-doers. 
59|20|al-Hashr: The Exile|Not equal are the owners of the Fire and the owners of the Garden. The  owners of the Garden, they are the victorious. 
59|21|al-Hashr: The Exile|If We had caused this Qur'an to descend upon a mountain, thou (O  Muhammad) verily hadst seen it humbled, rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such  similitudes coin We for mankind that haply they may reflect. 
59|22|al-Hashr: The Exile|He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Knower of the Invisible  and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. 
59|23|al-Hashr: The Exile|He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy  One, Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, the Compeller, the  Superb. Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him). 
59|24|al-Hashr: The Exile|He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the  most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Him, and He  is the Mighty, the Wise. 
60|1|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|O ye who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for allies. Do ye  give them friendship when they disbelieve in that truth which hath come unto you,  driving out the messenger and you because ye believe in Allah, your Lord ? If ye have  come forth to strive in My way and seeking My good pleasure, (show them not  friendship). Do ye show friendship unto them in secret, when I am Best Aware of  what ye hide and what ye proclaim ? And whosoever doeth it among you, he verily  hath strayed from the right way. 
60|2|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|If they have the upper hand of you, they will be your foes, and will stretch  out their hands and their tongues toward you with evil (intent), and they long for you  to disbelieve. 
60|3|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|Your ties of kindred and your children will avail you naught upon the Day of  Resurrection. He will part you. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
60|4|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|There is a goodly pattern for you in Abraham and those with him, when they  told their folk: Lo! we are guiltless of you and all that ye worship beside Allah. We  have done with you. And there hath arisen between us and you hostility and hate for  ever until ye believe in Allah only - save that which Abraham promised his father  (when he said): I will ask forgiveness for thee, though I own nothing for thee from  Allah - Our Lord! In Thee we put our trust, and unto Thee we turn repentant, and unto  Thee is the journeying. 
60|5|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|Our Lord! Make us not a prey for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our  Lord! Lo! Thou, only Thou, are the Mighty, the Wise. 
60|6|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|Verily ye have in them a goodly pattern for everyone who looketh to Allah  and the Last Day. And whosoever may turn away, lo! still Allah, He is the Absolute,  the Owner of Praise. 
60|7|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|It may be that Allah will ordain love between you and those of them with  whom ye are at enmity. Allah is Mighty, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
60|8|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|Allah forbiddeth you not those who warred not against you on account of  religion and drove you not out from your homes, that ye should show them kindness  and deal justly with them. Lo! Allah loveth the just dealers. 
60|9|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|Allah forbiddeth you only those who warred against you on account of  religion and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out, that  ye make friends of them. Whosoever maketh friends of them - (All) such are wrong- doers. 
60|10|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|O ye who believe! When believing women come unto you as fugitives,  examine them. Allah is Best Aware of their faith. Then, if ye know them for true  believers, send them not back unto the disbelievers. They are not lawful for them (the  disbelievers), nor are they (the disbelievers) lawful for them. And give them (the  disbelievers) that which they have spent (upon them). And it is no sin for you to  marry such women when ye have given them their dues. And hold not to the ties of  disbelieving women; and ask for (the return of) that which ye have spent; and let them  (the disbelievers) ask for that which they have spent. That is the judgment of Allah.  He judgeth between you. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
60|11|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|And if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers and  afterward ye have your turn (of triumph), then give unto those whose wives have  gone the like of that which they have spent, and keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye  are believers. 
60|12|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|O Prophet! If believing women come unto thee, taking oath of allegiance  unto thee that they will ascribe no thing as partner unto Allah, and will neither steal  nor commit adultery nor kill their children, nor produce any lie that they have devised  between their hands and feet, nor disobey thee in what is right, then accept their  allegiance and ask Allah to forgive them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
60|13|al-Mumtahanah: She Who is Tested|O ye who believe! Be not friendly with a folk with whom Allah is wroth, (a  folk) who have despaired of the Hereafter as the disbelievers despair of those who are  in the graves. 
61|1|as-Saff: The Ranks|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and He is  the Mighty, the Wise. 
61|2|as-Saff: The Ranks|O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not ? 
61|3|as-Saff: The Ranks|It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not. 
61|4|as-Saff: The Ranks|Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a  solid structure. 
61|5|as-Saff: The Ranks|And (remember) when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Why  persecute ye me, when ye well know that I am Allah's messenger unto you ? So when  they went astray Allah sent their hearts astray. And Allah guideth not the evil-living  folk. 
61|6|as-Saff: The Ranks|And when Jesus son of Mary said: O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the  messenger of Allah unto you, confirming that which was (revealed) before me in the  Torah, and bringing good tidings of a messenger who cometh after me, whose name  is the Praised One. Yet when he hath come unto them with clear proofs, they say:  This is mere magic. 
61|7|as-Saff: The Ranks|And who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah when  he is summoned unto Al-Islam ? And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
61|8|as-Saff: The Ranks|Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will  perfect His light however much the disbelievers are averse. 
61|9|as-Saff: The Ranks|He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of  truth, that He may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may be  averse. 
61|10|as-Saff: The Ranks|O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a  painful doom ? 
61|11|as-Saff: The Ranks|Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the  cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if ye did but  know. 
61|12|as-Saff: The Ranks|He will forgive you your sins and bring you into Gardens underneath which  rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme triumph. 
61|13|as-Saff: The Ranks|And (He will give you) another (blessing) which ye love: help from Allah  and present victory. Give good tidings (O Muhammad) to believers. 
61|14|as-Saff: The Ranks|O ye who believe! Be Allah's helpers, even as Jesus son of Mary said unto  the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah ? They said: We are Allah's helpers. And  a party of the Children of Israel believed, while a party disbelieved. Then We  strengthened those who believed against their foe, and they became the uppermost. 
62|1|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, the  Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise. 
62|2|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|He it is Who hath sent among the unlettered ones a messenger of their own,  to recite unto them His revelations and to make them grow, and to teach them the  Scripture and wisdom, though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest, 
62|3|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|Along with others of them who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty,  the Wise. 
62|4|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|That is the bounty of Allah; which He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of  Infinite Bounty. 
62|5|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it  not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who  deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
62|6|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews! If ye claim that ye are favoured of  Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if ye are truthful. 
62|7|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent  before, and Allah is Aware of evil-doers. 
62|8|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! the death from which ye shrink will  surely meet you, and afterward ye will be returned unto the Knower of the Invisible  and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. 
62|9|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|O ye who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of  congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah and leave your trading. That is better  for you if ye did but know. 
62|10|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|And when the prayer is ended, then disperse in the land and seek of Allah's  bounty, and remember Allah much, that ye may be successful. 
62|11|al-Jumu`ah: The Day of Congregation|But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and  leave thee standing. Say: That which Allah hath is better than pastime and than  merchandise, and Allah is the Best of providers. 
63|1|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad), they say: We bear  witness that thou art indeed Allah's messenger. And Allah knoweth that thou art  indeed His messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are  speaking falsely. 
63|2|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|They make their faith a pretext so that they may turn (men) from the way of  Allah. Verily evil is that which they are wont to do, 
63|3|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are  sealed so that they understand not. 
63|4|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou  givest ear unto their speech. (They are) as though they were blocks of wood in striped  cloaks. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of  them. Allah confound them! How they are perverted! 
63|5|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|And when it is said unto them: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask  forgiveness for you! they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away,  disdainful. 
63|6|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|Whether thou ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them is all  one for them; Allah will not forgive them. Lo! Allah guideth not the evil-living folk. 
63|7|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|They it is who say: Spend not on behalf of those (who dwell) with Allah's  messenger that they may disperse (and go away from you); when Allah's are the  treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites comprehend not. 
63|8|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|They say: Surely, if we return to Al-Madinah the mightier will soon drive out  the weaker; when might belongeth to Allah and to His messenger and to the believers;  but the hypocrites know not. 
63|9|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from  remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers. 
63|10|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh  unto one of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little  while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous. 
63|11|al-Munafiqun: The Hypocrites|But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allah is Informed of  what ye do. 
64|1|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah; unto  Him belongeth Sovereignty and unto Him belongeth praise, and He is Able to do all  things. 
64|2|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|He it is Who created you, but one of you is a disbeliever and one of you is a  believer, and Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
64|3|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|He created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and  made good your shapes, and unto Him is the journeying. 
64|4|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|He knoweth all that is in the heavens and the earth, and He knoweth what ye  conceal and what ye publish. And Allah is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men). 
64|5|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Hath not the story reached you of those who disbelieved of old and so did  taste the ill-effects of their conduct, and theirs will be a painful doom. 
64|6|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|That was because their messengers (from Allah) kept coming unto them with  clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), but they said: Shall mere mortals guide us ? So  they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah was independent (of them). Allah is  Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
64|7|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Those who disbelieve assert that they will not be raised again. Say (unto  them, O Muhammad): Yea, verily, by my Lord! ye will be raised again and then ye  will be informed of what ye did; and that is easy for Allah. 
64|8|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|So believe in Allah and His messenger and the light which We have  revealed. And Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
64|9|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|The day when He shall gather you unto the Day of Assembling, that will be a  day of mutual disillusion. And whoso believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will  remit from him his evil deeds and will bring him unto Gardens underneath which  rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph. 
64|10|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are owners of the  Fire; they will abide therein - a hapless journey's end! 
64|11|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|No calamity befalleth save by Allah's leave. And whosoever believeth in  Allah, He guideth his heart. And Allah is Knower of all things. 
64|12|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Obey Allah and obey His messenger; but if ye turn away, then the duty of  Our messenger is only to convey (the message) plainly. 
64|13|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Allah! There is no God save Him. In Allah, therefore, let believers put their  trust. 
64|14|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|O ye who believe! Lo! among your wives and your children there are  enemies for you, therefor beware of them. And if ye efface and overlook and forgive,  then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
64|15|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Your wealth and your children are only a temptation, whereas Allah! with  Him is an immense reward. 
64|16|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|So keep your duty to Allah as best ye can, and listen, and obey, and spend;  that is better for your souls. And whoso is saved from his own greed, such are the  successful. 
64|17|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|If ye lend unto Allah a goodly loan, He will double it for you and will  forgive you, for Allah is Responsive, Clement, 
64|18|at-Taghabun: The Cheating|Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the Wise. 
65|1|at-Talaq: The Divorce|O Prophet! When ye (men) put away women, put them away for their (legal)  period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them not  from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. Such are  the limits (imposed by) Allah; and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits, he verily  wrongeth his soul. Thou knowest not: it may be that Allah will afterward bring some  new thing to pass. 
65|2|at-Talaq: The Divorce|Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part  from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your  testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to  act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for  him, 
65|3|at-Talaq: The Divorce|And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation.  And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His  command to pass. Allah hath set a measure for all things. 
65|4|at-Talaq: The Divorce|And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their  period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And for  those with child, their period shall be till they bring forth their burden. And  whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him. 
65|5|at-Talaq: The Divorce|That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth unto you. And whoso  keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward  for him. 
65|6|at-Talaq: The Divorce|Lodge them where ye dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not  so as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them till they  bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them their due payment  and consult together in kindness; but if ye make difficulties for one another, then let  some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child). 
65|7|at-Talaq: The Divorce|Let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose  provision is measured, let him spend of that which Allah hath given him. Allah asketh  naught of any soul save that which He hath given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after  hardship, ease. 
65|8|at-Talaq: The Divorce|And how many a community revolted against the ordinance of its Lord and  His messengers, and We called it to a stern account and punished it with dire  punishment, 
65|9|at-Talaq: The Divorce|So that it tasted the ill-effects of its conduct, and the consequence of its  conduct was loss. 
65|10|at-Talaq: The Divorce|Allah hath prepared for them stern punishment; so keep your duty to Allah,  O men of understanding! O ye who believe! Now Allah hath sent down unto you a  reminder, 
65|11|at-Talaq: The Divorce|A messenger reciting unto you the revelations of Allah made plain, that He  may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness unto light. And  whosoever believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will bring him into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. Allah hath made good  provision for him. 
65|12|at-Talaq: The Divorce|Allah it is who hath created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof.  The commandment cometh down among them slowly, that ye may know that Allah is  Able to do all things, and that Allah surroundeth all things in knowledge. 
66|1|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee,  seeking to please thy wives ? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
66|2|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|Allah hath made lawful for you (Muslims) absolution from your oaths (of  such a kind), and Allah is your Protector. He is the Knower, the Wise. 
66|3|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|When the Prophet confided a fact unto one of his wives and when she  afterward divulged it and Allah apprised him thereof, he made known (to her) part  thereof and passed over part. And when he told it her she said: Who hath told thee ?  He said: The Knower, the Aware hath told me. 
66|4|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|If ye twain turn unto Allah repentant, (ye have cause to do so) for your hearts  desired (the ban); and if ye aid one another against him (Muhammad) then lo! Allah,  even He, is his Protecting Friend, and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers;  and furthermore the angels are his helpers. 
66|5|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|It may happen that his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your stead  wives better than you, submissive (to Allah), believing, pious, penitent, devout,  inclined to fasting, widows and maids. 
66|6|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|O ye who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire  whereof the fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels strong, severe, who  resist not Allah in that which He commandeth them, but do that which they are  commanded. 
66|7|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|(Then it will be said): O ye who disbelieve! Make no excuses for yourselves  this day. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do. 
66|8|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|O ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your  Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath  which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who  believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will  say: Our Lord!  Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all  things. 
66|9|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern  with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end. 
66|10|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the  wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous slaves yet betrayed them so that  they (the husbands) availed them naught against Allah and it was said (unto them):  Enter the Fire along with those who enter. 
66|11|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|And Allah citeth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh  when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver  me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk; 
66|12|at-Tahrim: The Prohibition|And Mary, daughter of 'Imran, whose body was chaste, therefor We breathed  therein something of Our Spirit. And she put faith in the words of her Lord and His  scriptures, and was of the obedient. 
67|1|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Sovereignty, and, He is Able to do all  things. 
67|2|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in  conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving, 
67|3|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see  no fault in the Beneficent One's creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ? 
67|4|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and  made dim. 
67|5|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with lamps, and We have  made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame. 
67|6|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a  hapless journey's end! 
67|7|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up, 
67|8|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|As it would burst with rage. Whenever a (fresh) host is flung therein the  wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner ? 
67|9|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah  hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error. 
67|10|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been  among the dwellers in the flames. 
67|11|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed (from mercy) are the  dwellers in the flames. 
67|12|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a great  reward. 
67|13|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in  the breasts (of men). 
67|14|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Should He not know what He created ? And He is the Subtile, the Aware. 
67|15|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|He it is Who hath made the earth subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths  thereof and eat of His providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the  dead). 
67|16|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause  the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed ? 
67|17|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let  loose on you a hurricane ? But ye shall know the manner of My warning. 
67|18|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And verily those before them denied, then (see) the manner of My wrath  (with them)! 
67|19|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and  closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all  things. 
67|20|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the  Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion. 
67|21|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence  ? Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness. 
67|22|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh  upright on a straight road ? 
67|23|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is who gave you being, and hath  assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye! 
67|24|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be  gathered. 
67|25|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? 
67|26|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner; 
67|27|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry,  and it will be said (unto them): This is that for which ye used to call. 
67|28|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me  (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect  the disbelievers from a painful doom ? 
67|29|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust.  And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest. 
67|30|al-Mulk: The Kingdom|Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your water were to disappear into the earth,  who then could bring you gushing water ? 
68|1|al-Qalam: The Pen|Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), 
68|2|al-Qalam: The Pen|Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. 
68|3|al-Qalam: The Pen|And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. 
68|4|al-Qalam: The Pen|And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. 
68|5|al-Qalam: The Pen|And thou wilt see and they will see 
68|6|al-Qalam: The Pen|Which of you is the demented. 
68|7|al-Qalam: The Pen|Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is  Best Aware of those who walk aright. 
68|8|al-Qalam: The Pen|Therefor obey not thou the rejecters 
68|9|al-Qalam: The Pen|Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. 
68|10|al-Qalam: The Pen|Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, 
68|11|al-Qalam: The Pen|Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, 
68|12|al-Qalam: The Pen|Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor 
68|13|al-Qalam: The Pen|Greedy therewithal, intrusive. 
68|14|al-Qalam: The Pen|It is because he is possessed of wealth and children 
68|15|al-Qalam: The Pen|That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the  men of old. 
68|16|al-Qalam: The Pen|We shall brand him on the nose. 
68|17|al-Qalam: The Pen|Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they  vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, 
68|18|al-Qalam: The Pen|And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); 
68|19|al-Qalam: The Pen|Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept 
68|20|al-Qalam: The Pen|And in the morning it was as if plucked. 
68|21|al-Qalam: The Pen|And they cried out one unto another in the morning, 
68|22|al-Qalam: The Pen|Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). 
68|23|al-Qalam: The Pen|So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: 
68|24|al-Qalam: The Pen|No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. 
68|25|al-Qalam: The Pen|They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. 
68|26|al-Qalam: The Pen|But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! 
68|27|al-Qalam: The Pen|Nay, but we are desolate! 
68|28|al-Qalam: The Pen|The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? 
68|29|al-Qalam: The Pen|They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. 
68|30|al-Qalam: The Pen|Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. 
68|31|al-Qalam: The Pen|They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. 
68|32|al-Qalam: The Pen|It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we  beseech our Lord. 
68|33|al-Qalam: The Pen|Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is  greater if they did but know. 
68|34|al-Qalam: The Pen|Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. 
68|35|al-Qalam: The Pen|Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? 
68|36|al-Qalam: The Pen|What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! 
68|37|al-Qalam: The Pen|Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn 
68|38|al-Qalam: The Pen|That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? 
68|39|al-Qalam: The Pen|Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,  that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? 
68|40|al-Qalam: The Pen|Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! 
68|41|al-Qalam: The Pen|Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are  truthful 
68|42|al-Qalam: The Pen|On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate  themselves but are not able, 
68|43|al-Qalam: The Pen|With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been  summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. 
68|44|al-Qalam: The Pen|Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We  shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. 
68|45|al-Qalam: The Pen|Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. 
68|46|al-Qalam: The Pen|Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed  ? 
68|47|al-Qalam: The Pen|Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? 
68|48|al-Qalam: The Pen|But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried  out in despair. 
68|49|al-Qalam: The Pen|Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had  been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. 
68|50|al-Qalam: The Pen|But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. 
68|51|al-Qalam: The Pen|And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes  when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; 
68|52|al-Qalam: The Pen|When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. 
69|1|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|The Reality! 
69|2|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|What is the Reality ? 
69|3|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! 
69|4|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|(The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. 
69|5|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. 
69|6|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, 
69|7|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that  thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. 
69|8|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? 
69|9|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were  destroyed, brought error, 
69|10|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them  with a tightening grip. 
69|11|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship 
69|12|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that  heard the story) might remember. 
69|13|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And when the trumpet shall sound one blast 
69|14|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one  crash, 
69|15|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Then, on that day will the Event befall. 
69|16|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. 
69|17|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne  of thy Lord that day, above them. 
69|18|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. 
69|19|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take,  read my book! 
69|20|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. 
69|21|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Then he will be in blissful state 
69|22|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|In a high garden 
69|23|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. 
69|24|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|(And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which  ye sent on before you in past days. 
69|25|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,  would that I had not been given my book 
69|26|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And knew not what my reckoning! 
69|27|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Oh, would that it had been death! 
69|28|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|My wealth hath not availed me, 
69|29|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|My power hath gone from me. 
69|30|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|(It will be said): Take him and fetter him 
69|31|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And then expose him to hell-fire 
69|32|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. 
69|33|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, 
69|34|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. 
69|35|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Therefor hath he no lover here this day, 
69|36|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Nor any food save filth 
69|37|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Which none but sinners eat. 
69|38|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|But nay! I swear by all that ye see 
69|39|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And all that ye see not 
69|40|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. 
69|41|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! 
69|42|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! 
69|43|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. 
69|44|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, 
69|45|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|We assuredly had taken him by the right hand 
69|46|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And then severed his life-artery, 
69|47|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And not one of you could have held Us off from him. 
69|48|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). 
69|49|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). 
69|50|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. 
69|51|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|And lo! it is absolute truth. 
69|52|al-Haqqah: The Inevitable|So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord. 
70|1|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall 
70|2|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel, 
70|3|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways 
70|4|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|(Whereby) the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the  span is fifty thousand years. 
70|5|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|But be patient (O Muhammad) with a patience fair to see. 
70|6|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Lo! they behold it afar off 
70|7|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|While we behold it nigh: 
70|8|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|The day when the sky will become as molten copper, 
70|9|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And the hills become as flakes of wool, 
70|10|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend 
70|11|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Though they will be given sight of them. The guilty man will long to be able  to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children 
70|12|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And his spouse and his brother 
70|13|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And his kin that harboured him 
70|14|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And all that are in the earth, if then it might deliver him. 
70|15|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell 
70|16|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Eager to roast; 
70|17|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|It calleth him who turned and fled (from truth), 
70|18|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And hoarded (wealth) and withheld it. 
70|19|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Lo! man was created anxious, 
70|20|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Fretful when evil befalleth him 
70|21|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And, when good befalleth him, grudging; 
70|22|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Save worshippers. 
70|23|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Who are constant at their worship 
70|24|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged 
70|25|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|For the beggar and the destitute; 
70|26|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who believe in the Day of Judgment, 
70|27|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom - 
70|28|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure - 
70|29|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who preserve their chastity 
70|30|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess, for thus  they are not blameworthy; 
70|31|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors; 
70|32|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who keep their pledges and their covenant, 
70|33|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who stand by their testimony 
70|34|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|And those who are attentive at their worship. 
70|35|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|These will dwell in Gardens, honoured. 
70|36|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|What aileth those who disbelieve, that they keep staring toward thee (O  Muhammad), open-eyed, 
70|37|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|On the right and on the left, in groups ? 
70|38|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight ? 
70|39|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from what they know. 
70|40|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising-places and the setting-places of the  planets that We verily are Able 
70|41|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|To replace them by (others) better than them. And we are not to be outrun. 
70|42|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|So let them chat and play until they meet their Day which they are promised, 
70|43|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|The day when they come forth from the graves in haste, as racing to a goal, 
70|44|al-Ma`arij: The Ladders|With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying them: Such is the Day which they  are promised. 
71|1|Nuh: Noah|Lo! We sent Noah unto his people (saying): Warn thy people ere the painful  doom come unto them. 
71|2|Nuh: Noah|He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you 
71|3|Nuh: Noah|(Bidding you): Serve Allah and keep your duty unto Him and obey me, 
71|4|Nuh: Noah|That He may forgive you somewhat of your sins and respite you to an  appointed term. Lo! the term of Allah, when it cometh, cannot be delayed, if ye but  knew. 
71|5|Nuh: Noah|He said: My Lord! Lo! I have called unto my people night and day 
71|6|Nuh: Noah|But all my calling doth but add to their repugnance; 
71|7|Nuh: Noah|And lo! whenever I call unto them that Thou mayst pardon them they thrust  their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their garments and persist (in  their refusal) and magnify themselves in pride. 
71|8|Nuh: Noah|And lo! I have called unto them aloud, 
71|9|Nuh: Noah|And lo! I have made public proclamation unto them, and I have appealed to  them in private. 
71|10|Nuh: Noah|And I have said: Seek pardon of your Lord. Lo! He was ever Forgiving. 
71|11|Nuh: Noah|He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain, 
71|12|Nuh: Noah|And will help you with wealth and sons, and will assign unto you Gardens  and will assign unto you rivers. 
71|13|Nuh: Noah|What aileth you that ye hope not toward Allah for dignity 
71|14|Nuh: Noah|When He created you by (divers) stages ? 
71|15|Nuh: Noah|See ye not how Allah hath created seven heavens in harmony, 
71|16|Nuh: Noah|And hath made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp ? 
71|17|Nuh: Noah|And Allah hath caused you to grow as a growth from the earth, 
71|18|Nuh: Noah|And afterward He maketh you return thereto, and He will bring you forth  again, a (new) forthbringing. 
71|19|Nuh: Noah|And Allah hath made the earth a wide expanse for you 
71|20|Nuh: Noah|That ye may thread the valley-ways thereof. 
71|21|Nuh: Noah|Noah said: My Lord! Lo! they have disobeyed me and followed one whose  wealth and children increase him in naught save ruin; 
71|22|Nuh: Noah|And they have plotted a mighty plot, 
71|23|Nuh: Noah|And they have said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa',  nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. 
71|24|Nuh: Noah|And they have led many astray, and Thou increasest the wrong-doers in  naught save error. 
71|25|Nuh: Noah|Because of their sins they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And they  found they had no helpers in place of Allah. 
71|26|Nuh: Noah|And Noah said: My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land. 
71|27|Nuh: Noah|If Thou shouldst leave them, they will mislead Thy slaves and will beget  none save lewd ingrates. 
71|28|Nuh: Noah|My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house  believing, and believing men and believing women, and increase not the wrong-doers  in aught save ruin. 
72|1|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave  ear, and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Qur'an, 
72|2|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no  partner unto our Lord. 
72|3|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And (we believe) that He - exalted be the glory of our Lord! - hath taken  neither wife nor son, 
72|4|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an  atrocious lie. 
72|5|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie  concerning Allah - 
72|6|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the  protection of individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt against  Allah); 
72|7|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise  anyone (from the dead) - 
72|8|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And (the Jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said): We had sought the  heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors. 
72|9|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And we used to sit on places (high) therein to listen. But he who listeneth  now findeth a flame in wait for him; 
72|10|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or  whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them. 
72|11|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that.  We are sects having different rules. 
72|12|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we  escape by flight. 
72|13|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth  in his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression. 
72|14|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah) and there are  among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have  taken the right path purposefully. 
72|15|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell. 
72|16|al-Jinn: The Jinn|If they (the idolaters) tread the right path, We shall give them to drink of  water in abundance 
72|17|al-Jinn: The Jinn|That We may test them thereby, and whoso turneth away from the  remembrance of his Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment. 
72|18|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And the places of worship are only for Allah, so pray not unto anyone along  with Allah. 
72|19|al-Jinn: The Jinn|And when the slave of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded on  him, almost stifling. 
72|20|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe unto  Him no partner. 
72|21|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Say: Lo! I control not hurt nor benefit for you. 
72|22|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Say: Lo! none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge beside  Him 
72|23|al-Jinn: The Jinn|(Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah, and His messages; and  whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger, lo! his is fire of hell, wherein such dwell  for ever. 
72|24|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Till (the day) when they shall behold that which they are promised (they may  doubt); but then they will know (for certain) who is weaker in allies and less in  multitude. 
72|25|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): I know not whether that which ye  are promised is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it. 
72|26|al-Jinn: The Jinn|(He is) the Knower of the Unseen, and He revealeth unto none His secret, 
72|27|al-Jinn: The Jinn|Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a  guard to go before him and a guard behind him 
72|28|al-Jinn: The Jinn|That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their  Lord. He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all things. 
73|1|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|O thou wrapped up in thy raiment! 
73|2|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Keep vigil the night long, save a little - 
73|3|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|A half thereof, or abate a little thereof 
73|4|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Or add (a little) thereto - and chant the Qur'an in measure, 
73|5|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|For we shall charge thee with a word of weight. 
73|6|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! the vigil of the night is (a time) when impression is more keen and  speech more certain. 
73|7|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! thou hast by day a chain of business. 
73|8|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|So remember the name of thy Lord and devote thyself with a complete  devotion - 
73|9|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lord of the East and the West; there is no God save Him; so choose thou  Him alone for thy defender - 
73|10|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|And bear with patience what they utter, and part from them with a fair leave- taking. 
73|11|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Leave Me to deal with the deniers, lords of ease and comfort (in this life);  and do thou respite them awhile. 
73|12|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! with Us are heavy fetters and a raging fire, 
73|13|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|And food which choketh (the partaker), and a painful doom 
73|14|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|On the day when the earth and the hills rock, and the hills become a heap of  running sand. 
73|15|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! We have sent unto you a messenger as witness against you, even as We  sent unto Pharaoh a messenger. 
73|16|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger, whereupon We seized him with  no gentle grip. 
73|17|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Then how, if ye disbelieve, will ye protect yourselves upon the day which  will turn children grey, 
73|18|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|The very heaven being then rent asunder. His promise is to be fulfilled. 
73|19|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! This is a Reminder. Let him who will, then, choose a way unto his Lord. 
73|20|al-Muzammil: The Mantled One|Lo! thy Lord knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly two-thirds of  the night, or (sometimes) half or a third thereof, as do a party of those with thee.  Allah measureth the night and the day. He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth  unto you in mercy. Recite, then, of the Qur'an that which is easy for you. He knoweth  that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah's  bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which  is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto  Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find  it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah.  Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
74|1|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|O thou enveloped in thy cloak, 
74|2|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Arise and warn! 
74|3|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Thy Lord magnify, 
74|4|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Thy raiment purify, 
74|5|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Pollution shun! 
74|6|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And show not favour, seeking wordly gain! 
74|7|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|For the sake of thy Lord, be patient! 
74|8|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|For when the trumpet shall sound, 
74|9|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Surely that day will be a day of anguish, 
74|10|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Not of ease, for disbelievers. 
74|11|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely, 
74|12|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And then bestowed upon him ample means, 
74|13|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And sons abiding in his presence 
74|14|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And made (life) smooth for him. 
74|15|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Yet he desireth that I should give more. 
74|16|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations. 
74|17|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|On him I shall impose a fearful doom. 
74|18|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|For lo! he did consider; then he planned - 
74|19|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|(Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! 
74|20|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! - 
74|21|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Then looked he, 
74|22|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Then frowned he and showed displeasure. 
74|23|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Then turned he away in pride 
74|24|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And said: This is naught else than magic from of old; 
74|25|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|This is naught else than speech of mortal man. 
74|26|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Him shall I fling unto the burning. 
74|27|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One| - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! - 
74|28|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|It leaveth naught; it spareth naught 
74|29|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|It shrivelleth the man. 
74|30|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Above it are nineteen. 
74|31|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number  have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom  the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in  faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not  doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say:  What meaneth Allah by this similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will,  and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is  naught else than a Reminder unto mortals. 
74|32|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nay, by the Moon 
74|33|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And the night when it withdraweth 
74|34|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And the dawn when it shineth forth, 
74|35|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Lo! this is one of the greatest (portents) 
74|36|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|As a warning unto men, 
74|37|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Unto him of you who will advance or hang back. 
74|38|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds; 
74|39|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Save those who will stand on the right hand. 
74|40|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|In gardens they will ask one another 
74|41|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Concerning the guilty: 
74|42|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|What hath brought you to this burning ? 
74|43|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|They will answer: We were not of those who prayed 
74|44|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nor did we feed the wretched. 
74|45|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|We used to wade (in vain dispute) with (all) waders, 
74|46|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, 
74|47|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Till the Inevitable came unto us. 
74|48|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. 
74|49|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Why now turn they away from the Admonishment, 
74|50|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|As they were frightened asses 
74|51|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Fleeing from a lion ? 
74|52|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from  Allah). 
74|53|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter. 
74|54|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|Nay, verily. Lo! this is an Admonishment. 
74|55|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|So whosoever will may heed. 
74|56|al-Mudathir: The Clothed One|And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is  the fount of Mercy. 
75|1|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection; 
75|2|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that this Scripture is true). 
75|3|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Thinketh man that We shall not assemble his bones ? 
75|4|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Yea, verily. We are Able to restore his very fingers! 
75|5|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|But man would fain deny what is before him. 
75|6|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|He asketh: When will be this Day of Resurrection ? 
75|7|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|But when sight is confounded 
75|8|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And the moon is eclipsed 
75|9|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And sun and moon are united, 
75|10|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|On that day man will cry: Whither to flee! 
75|11|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Alas! No refuge! 
75|12|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Unto thy Lord is the recourse that day. 
75|13|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|On that day man is told the tale of that which he hath sent before and left  behind. 
75|14|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Oh, but man is a telling witness against himself, 
75|15|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Although he tender his excuses. 
75|16|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten it. 
75|17|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting together thereof and the reading thereof. 
75|18|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And when We read it, follow thou the reading; 
75|19|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the explanation thereof. 
75|20|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now 
75|21|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And neglect the Hereafter. 
75|22|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|That day will faces be resplendent, 
75|23|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Looking toward their Lord; 
75|24|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And that day will other faces be despondent, 
75|25|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Thou wilt know that some great disaster is about to fall on them. 
75|26|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Nay, but when the life cometh up to the throat 
75|27|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And men say: Where is the wizard (who can save him now) ? 
75|28|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And he knoweth that it is the parting; 
75|29|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And agony is heaped on agony; 
75|30|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Unto thy Lord that day will be the driving. 
75|31|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|For he neither trusted, nor prayed. 
75|32|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|But he denied and flouted. 
75|33|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Then went he to his folk with glee. 
75|34|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Nearer unto thee and nearer, 
75|35|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Again nearer unto thee and nearer (is the doom). 
75|36|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Thinketh man that he is to be left aimless ? 
75|37|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Was he not a drop of fluid which gushed forth ? 
75|38|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Then he became a clot; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned 
75|39|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|And made of him a pair, the male and female. 
75|40|al-Qiyamah: The Resurrection|Is not He (Who doeth so) Able to bring the dead to life ? 
76|1|ad-Dahr: The Man|Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing  unremembered ? 
76|2|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make  him hearing, knowing. 
76|3|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. 
76|4|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging  fire. 
76|5|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, 
76|6|ad-Dahr: The Man|A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth  abundantly, 
76|7|ad-Dahr: The Man|(Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, 
76|8|ad-Dahr: The Man|And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love  of Him, 
76|9|ad-Dahr: The Man|(Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward  nor thanks from you; 
76|10|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. 
76|11|ad-Dahr: The Man|Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath  made them find brightness and joy; 
76|12|ad-Dahr: The Man|And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; 
76|13|ad-Dahr: The Man|Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun  nor bitter cold. 
76|14|ad-Dahr: The Man|The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow  down. 
76|15|ad-Dahr: The Man|Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass 
76|16|ad-Dahr: The Man|(Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have  measured to the measure (of their deeds). 
76|17|ad-Dahr: The Man|There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, 
76|18|ad-Dahr: The Man|(The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. 
76|19|ad-Dahr: The Man|There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst  take for scattered pearls. 
76|20|ad-Dahr: The Man|When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. 
76|21|ad-Dahr: The Man|Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver  will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. 
76|22|ad-Dahr: The Man|(And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour  (upon earth) hath found acceptance. 
76|23|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; 
76|24|ad-Dahr: The Man|So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty  one or disbeliever. 
76|25|ad-Dahr: The Man|Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. 
76|26|ad-Dahr: The Man|And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the  livelong night. 
76|27|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a  grievous day. 
76|28|ad-Dahr: The Man|We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We  will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. 
76|29|ad-Dahr: The Man|Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto  his Lord. 
76|30|ad-Dahr: The Man|Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. 
76|31|ad-Dahr: The Man|He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath  prepared a painful doom. 
77|1|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|By the emissary winds, (sent) one after another 
77|2|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|By the raging hurricanes, 
77|3|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|By those which cause earth's vegetation to revive; 
77|4|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|By those who winnow with a winnowing, 
77|5|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|By those who bring down the Reminder, 
77|6|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|To excuse or to warn, 
77|7|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Surely that which ye are promised will befall. 
77|8|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|So when the stars are put out, 
77|9|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And when the sky is riven asunder, 
77|10|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And when the mountains are blown away, 
77|11|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And when the messengers are brought unto their time appointed - 
77|12|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|For what day is the time appointed ? 
77|13|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|For the Day of Decision. 
77|14|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And what will convey unto thee what the Day of Decision is! - 
77|15|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|16|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Destroyed We not the former folk, 
77|17|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Then caused the latter folk to follow after ? 
77|18|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Thus deal We ever with the guilty. 
77|19|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|20|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Did We not create you from a base fluid 
77|21|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Which We laid up in a safe abode 
77|22|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|For a known term ? 
77|23|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Thus We arranged. How excellent is Our arranging! 
77|24|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|25|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Have We not made the earth a receptacle 
77|26|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Both for the living and the dead, 
77|27|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And placed therein high mountains and given you to drink sweet water  therein ? 
77|28|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|29|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|(It will be said unto them:) Depart unto that (doom) which ye used to deny; 
77|30|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Depart unto the shadow falling threefold, 
77|31|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|(Which yet is) no relief nor shelter from the flame. 
77|32|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Lo! it throweth up sparks like the castles, 
77|33|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|(Or) as it might be camels of bright yellow hue. 
77|34|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|35|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|This is a day wherein they speak not, 
77|36|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Nor are they suffered to put forth excuses. 
77|37|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|38|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|This is the Day of Decision, We have brought you and the men of old  together. 
77|39|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|If now ye have any wit, outwit Me. 
77|40|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|41|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Lo! those who kept their duty are amid shade and fountains, 
77|42|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|And fruits such as they desire. 
77|43|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|(Unto them it is said:) Eat, drink and welcome, O ye blessed, in return for  what ye did. 
77|44|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Thus do We reward the good. 
77|45|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|46|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Eat and take your ease (on earth) a little. Lo! ye are guilty. 
77|47|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|48|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|When it is said unto them: Bow down, they bow not down! 
77|49|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
77|50|al-Mursalat: The Emissaries|In what statement, after this, will they believe ? 
78|1|an-Naba': The Tidings|Whereof do they question one another ? 
78|2|an-Naba': The Tidings|(It is) of the awful tidings, 
78|3|an-Naba': The Tidings|Concerning which they are in disagreement. 
78|4|an-Naba': The Tidings|Nay, but they will come to know! 
78|5|an-Naba': The Tidings|Nay, again, but they will come to know! 
78|6|an-Naba': The Tidings|Have We not made the earth an expanse, 
78|7|an-Naba': The Tidings|And the high hills bulwarks ? 
78|8|an-Naba': The Tidings|And We have created you in pairs, 
78|9|an-Naba': The Tidings|And have appointed your sleep for repose, 
78|10|an-Naba': The Tidings|And have appointed the night as a cloak, 
78|11|an-Naba': The Tidings|And have appointed the day for livelihood. 
78|12|an-Naba': The Tidings|And We have built above you seven strong (heavens), 
78|13|an-Naba': The Tidings|And have appointed a dazzling lamp, 
78|14|an-Naba': The Tidings|And have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water, 
78|15|an-Naba': The Tidings|Thereby to produce grain and plant, 
78|16|an-Naba': The Tidings|And gardens of thick foliage. 
78|17|an-Naba': The Tidings|Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time, 
78|18|an-Naba': The Tidings|A day when the trumpet is blown and ye come in multitudes, 
78|19|an-Naba': The Tidings|And the heaven is opened and becometh as gates, 
78|20|an-Naba': The Tidings|And the hills are set in motion and become as a mirage. 
78|21|an-Naba': The Tidings|Lo! hell lurketh in ambush, 
78|22|an-Naba': The Tidings|A home for the rebellious. 
78|23|an-Naba': The Tidings|They will abide therein for ages. 
78|24|an-Naba': The Tidings|Therein taste they neither coolness nor (any) drink 
78|25|an-Naba': The Tidings|Save boiling water and a paralysing cold: 
78|26|an-Naba': The Tidings|Reward proportioned (to their evil deeds). 
78|27|an-Naba': The Tidings|For lo! they looked not for a reckoning; 
78|28|an-Naba': The Tidings|They called Our revelations false with strong denial. 
78|29|an-Naba': The Tidings|Everything have We recorded in a Book. 
78|30|an-Naba': The Tidings|So taste (of that which ye have earned). No increase do We give you save of  torment. 
78|31|an-Naba': The Tidings|Lo! for the duteous is achievement - 
78|32|an-Naba': The Tidings|Gardens enclosed and vineyards, 
78|33|an-Naba': The Tidings|And maidens for companions, 
78|34|an-Naba': The Tidings|And a full cup. 
78|35|an-Naba': The Tidings|There hear they never vain discourse, nor lying - 
78|36|an-Naba': The Tidings|Requital from thy Lord - a gift in payment - 
78|37|an-Naba': The Tidings|Lord of the heavens and the earth, and (all) that is between them, the  Beneficent; with Whom none can converse. 
78|38|an-Naba': The Tidings|On the day when the angels and the Spirit stand arrayed, they speak not,  saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth and who speaketh right. 
78|39|an-Naba': The Tidings|That is the True Day. So whoso will should seek recourse unto his Lord. 
78|40|an-Naba': The Tidings|Lo! We warn you of a doom at hand, a day whereon a man will look on that  which his own hands have sent before, and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I  were dust!" 
79|1|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|By those who drag forth to destruction,

79|7|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And the second followeth it, 
79|8|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|On that day hearts beat painfully 
79|9|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|While eyes are downcast 
79|10|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|(Now) they are saying: Shall we really be restored to our first state 
79|11|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Even after we are crumbled bones ? 
79|12|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|They say: Then that would be a vain proceeding. 
79|13|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Surely it will need but one shout, 
79|14|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And lo! they will be awakened. 
79|15|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Hath there come unto thee the history of Moses ? 
79|16|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa, 
79|17|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|(Saying:) Go thou unto Pharaoh - Lo! he hath rebelled - 
79|18|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And say (unto him): Hast thou (will) to grow (in grace) ? 
79|19|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Then I will guide thee to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him). 
79|20|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And he showed him the tremendous token. 
79|21|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|But he denied and disobeyed, 
79|22|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Then turned he away in haste, 
79|23|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Then gathered he and summoned 
79|24|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest." 
79|25|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|So Allah seized him (and made him) an example for the after (life) and for  the former. 
79|26|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him who feareth. 
79|27|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built ? 
79|28|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|He raised the height thereof and ordered it; 
79|29|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof. 
79|30|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And after that He spread the earth, 
79|31|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof, 
79|32|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And He made fast the hills, 
79|33|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|A provision for you and for your cattle. 
79|34|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|But when the great disaster cometh, 
79|35|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|The day when man will call to mind his (whole) endeavour, 
79|36|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth, 
79|37|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Then, as for him who rebelled 
79|38|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|And chose the life of the world, 
79|39|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Lo! hell will be his home. 
79|40|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|But as for him who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul  from lust, 
79|41|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Lo! the Garden will be his home. 
79|42|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|They ask thee of the Hour: when will it come to port ? 
79|43|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Why (ask they) ? What hast thou to tell thereof ? 
79|44|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof. 
79|45|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|Thou art but a warner unto him who feareth it. 
79|46|an-Nazi`at: Those Who Pull Out|On the day when they behold it, it will be as if they had but tarried for an  evening or the morn thereof. 
80|1|`Abasa: He Frowned|He frowned and turned away 
80|2|`Abasa: He Frowned|Because the blind man came unto him. 
80|3|`Abasa: He Frowned|What could inform thee but that he might grow (in grace) 
80|4|`Abasa: He Frowned|Or take heed and so the reminder might avail him ? 
80|5|`Abasa: He Frowned|As for him who thinketh himself independent, 
80|6|`Abasa: He Frowned|Unto him thou payest regard. 
80|7|`Abasa: He Frowned|Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace). 
80|8|`Abasa: He Frowned|But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose 
80|9|`Abasa: He Frowned|And hath fear, 
80|10|`Abasa: He Frowned|From him thou art distracted. 
80|11|`Abasa: He Frowned|Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment, 
80|12|`Abasa: He Frowned|So let whosoever will pay heed to it, 
80|13|`Abasa: He Frowned|On honoured leaves 
80|14|`Abasa: He Frowned|Exalted, purified, 
80|15|`Abasa: He Frowned|(Set down) by scribes 
80|16|`Abasa: He Frowned|Noble and righteous. 
80|17|`Abasa: He Frowned|Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful! 
80|18|`Abasa: He Frowned|From what thing doth He create him ? 
80|19|`Abasa: He Frowned|From a drop of seed. He createth him and proportioneth him, 
80|20|`Abasa: He Frowned|Then maketh the way easy for him, 
80|21|`Abasa: He Frowned|Then causeth him to die, and burieth him; 
80|22|`Abasa: He Frowned|Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life. 
80|23|`Abasa: He Frowned|Nay, but (man) hath not done what He commanded him. 
80|24|`Abasa: He Frowned|Let man consider his food: 
80|25|`Abasa: He Frowned|How We pour water in showers 
80|26|`Abasa: He Frowned|Then split the earth in clefts 
80|27|`Abasa: He Frowned|And cause the grain to grow therein 
80|28|`Abasa: He Frowned|And grapes and green fodder 
80|29|`Abasa: He Frowned|And olive-trees and palm-trees 
80|30|`Abasa: He Frowned|And garden-closes of thick foliage 
80|31|`Abasa: He Frowned|And fruits and grasses: 
80|32|`Abasa: He Frowned|Provision for you and your cattle. 
80|33|`Abasa: He Frowned|But when the Shout cometh 
80|34|`Abasa: He Frowned|On the day when a man fleeth from his brother 
80|35|`Abasa: He Frowned|And his mother and his father 
80|36|`Abasa: He Frowned|And his wife and his children, 
80|37|`Abasa: He Frowned|Every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless (of  others). 
80|38|`Abasa: He Frowned|On that day faces will be bright as dawn, 
80|39|`Abasa: He Frowned|Laughing, rejoicing at good news; 
80|40|`Abasa: He Frowned|And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them, 
80|41|`Abasa: He Frowned|Veiled in darkness, 
80|42|`Abasa: He Frowned|Those are the disbelievers, the wicked. 
81|1|at-Takwir: The Cessation|When the sun is overthrown, 
81|2|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the stars fall, 
81|3|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the hills are moved, 
81|4|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the camels big with young are abandoned, 
81|5|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the wild beasts are herded together, 
81|6|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the seas rise, 
81|7|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when souls are reunited, 
81|8|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the girl-child that was buried alive is asked 
81|9|at-Takwir: The Cessation|For what sin she was slain, 
81|10|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the pages are laid open, 
81|11|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the sky is torn away, 
81|12|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when hell is lighted, 
81|13|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And when the Garden is brought nigh, 
81|14|at-Takwir: The Cessation|(Then) every soul will know what it hath made ready. 
81|15|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Oh, but I call to witness the planets, 
81|16|at-Takwir: The Cessation|The stars which rise and set, 
81|17|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And the close of night, 
81|18|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And the breath of morning 
81|19|at-Takwir: The Cessation|That this is in truth the word of an honoured messenger, 
81|20|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Mighty, established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne, 
81|21|at-Takwir: The Cessation|(One) to be obeyed, and trustworthy; 
81|22|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And your comrade is not mad. 
81|23|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Surely he beheld Him on the clear horizon. 
81|24|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And he is not avid of the Unseen. 
81|25|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Nor is this the utterance of a devil worthy to be stoned. 
81|26|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Whither then go ye ? 
81|27|at-Takwir: The Cessation|This is naught else than a reminder unto creation, 
81|28|at-Takwir: The Cessation|Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight. 
81|29|at-Takwir: The Cessation|And ye will not, unless (it be) that Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation. 
82|1|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|When the heaven is cleft asunder, 
82|2|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|When the planets are dispersed, 
82|3|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|When the seas are poured forth, 
82|4|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|And the sepulchres are overturned, 
82|5|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|A soul will know what it hath sent before (it) and what left behind. 
82|6|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|O man! What hath made thee careless concerning thy Lord, the Bountiful, 
82|7|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Who created thee, then fashioned, then proportioned thee ? 
82|8|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Into whatsoever form He will, He casteth thee. 
82|9|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Nay, but ye deny the Judgment. 
82|10|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Lo! there are above you guardians, 
82|11|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Generous and recording, 
82|12|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Who know (all) that ye do. 
82|13|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Lo! the righteous verily will be in delight. 
82|14|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|And lo! the wicked verily will be in hell; 
82|15|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|They will burn therein on the Day of Judgment, 
82|16|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|And will not be absent thence. 
82|17|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Day of Judgment is! 
82|18|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|Again, what will convey unto thee what the Day of Judgment is! 
82|19|al-Infitar: The Cleaving Asunder|A day on which no soul hath power at all for any (other) soul. The (absolute)  command on that day is Allah's. 
83|1|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Woe unto the defrauders: 
83|2|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Those who when they take the measure from mankind demand it full, 
83|3|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|But if they measure unto them or weight for them, they cause them loss. 
83|4|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Do such (men) not consider that they will be raised again 
83|5|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Unto an Awful Day, 
83|6|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|The day when (all) mankind stand before the Lord of the Worlds ? 
83|7|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Nay, but the record of the vile is in Sijjin - 
83|8|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is! - 
83|9|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|A written record. 
83|10|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Woe unto the repudiators on that day! 
83|11|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Those who deny the Day of Judgment 
83|12|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Which none denieth save each criminal transgressor, 
83|13|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Who, when thou readest unto him Our revelations, saith: (Mere) fables of the  men of old. 
83|14|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts. 
83|15|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Nay, but surely on that day they will be covered from (the mercy of) their  Lord. 
83|16|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Then lo! they verily will burn in hell, 
83|17|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|And it will be said (unto them): This is that which ye used to deny. 
83|18|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Nay, but the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyin - 
83|19|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Ah, what will convey unto thee what 'Illiyin is! - 
83|20|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|A written record, 
83|21|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Attested by those who are brought near (unto their Lord). 
83|22|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Lo! the righteous verily are in delight, 
83|23|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|On couches, gazing, 
83|24|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Thou wilt know in their faces the radiance of delight. 
83|25|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|They are given to drink of a pure wine, sealed, 
83|26|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Whose seal is musk - for this let (all) those strive who strive for bliss - 
83|27|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|And mixed with water of Tasnim, 
83|28|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|A spring whence those brought near (to Allah) drink. 
83|29|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Lo! the guilty used to laugh at those who believed, 
83|30|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|And wink one to another when they passed them; 
83|31|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|And when they returned to their own folk, they returned jesting; 
83|32|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|And when they saw them they said: Lo! these have gone astray. 
83|33|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Yet they were not sent as guardians over them. 
83|34|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|This day it is those who believe who have the laugh of disbelievers, 
83|35|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|On high couches, gazing. 
83|36|at-Tatfif: The Defrauders|Are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do ? 
84|1|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|When the heaven is split asunder 
84|2|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And attentive to her Lord in fear, 
84|3|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And when the earth is spread out 
84|4|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty 
84|5|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And attentive to her Lord in fear! 
84|6|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Thou, verily, O man, art working toward thy Lord a work which thou wilt  meet (in His presence). 
84|7|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Then whoso is given his account in his right hand 
84|8|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|He truly will receive an easy reckoning 
84|9|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And will return unto his folk in joy. 
84|10|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|But whoso is given his account behind his back, 
84|11|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|He surely will invoke destruction 
84|12|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And be thrown to scorching fire. 
84|13|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|He verily lived joyous with his folk, 
84|14|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah). 
84|15|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him! 
84|16|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset, 
84|17|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And by the night and all that it enshroudeth, 
84|18|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And by the moon when she is at the full, 
84|19|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|That ye shall journey on from plane to plane. 
84|20|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|What aileth them, then, that they believe not 
84|21|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ? 
84|22|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny; 
84|23|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding. 
84|24|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|So give them tidings of a painful doom, 
84|25|al-Inshiqaq: The Rending|Save those who believe and do good works, for theirs is a reward unfailing. 
85|1|al-Buruj: the Constellations|By the heaven, holding mansions of the stars, 
85|2|al-Buruj: the Constellations|And by the Promised Day. 
85|3|al-Buruj: the Constellations|And by the witness and that whereunto he beareth testimony, 
85|4|al-Buruj: the Constellations|(Self-)destroyed were the owners of the ditch 
85|5|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Of the fuel-fed fire, 
85|6|al-Buruj: the Constellations|When they sat by it, 
85|7|al-Buruj: the Constellations|And were themselves the witnesses of what they did to the believers. 
85|8|al-Buruj: the Constellations|They had naught against them save that they believed in Allah, the Mighty,  the Owner of Praise, 
85|9|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and  Allah is of all things the Witness. 
85|10|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Lo! they who persecute believing men and believing women and repent not,  theirs verily will be the doom of hell, and theirs the doom of burning. 
85|11|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs will be Gardens underneath  which rivers flow. That is the Great Success. 
85|12|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Lo! the punishment of thy Lord is stern. 
85|13|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Lo! He it is Who produceth, then reproduceth, 
85|14|al-Buruj: the Constellations|And He is the Forgiving, the Loving, 
85|15|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Lord of the Throne of Glory, 
85|16|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Doer of what He will. 
85|17|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Hath there come unto thee the story of the hosts 
85|18|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Of Pharaoh and (the tribe of) Thamud ? 
85|19|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Nay, but those who disbelieve live in denial 
85|20|al-Buruj: the Constellations|And Allah, all unseen, surroundeth them. 
85|21|al-Buruj: the Constellations|Nay, but it is a glorious Qur'an. 
85|22|al-Buruj: the Constellations|On a guarded tablet. 
86|1|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|By the heaven and the Morning Star 
86|2|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer| - Ah, what will tell thee what the Morning Star is! 
86|3|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|- The piercing Star! 
86|4|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|No human soul but hath a guardian over it. 
86|5|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|So let man consider from what he is created. 
86|6|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|He is created from a gushing fluid 
86|7|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|That issued from between the loins and ribs. 
86|8|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|Lo! He verily is Able to return him (unto life) 
86|9|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|On the day when hidden thoughts shall be searched out. 
86|10|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|Then will he have no might nor any helper. 
86|11|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|By the heaven which giveth the returning rain, 
86|12|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|And the earth which splitteth (with the growth of trees and plants) 
86|13|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|Lo! this (Qur'an) is a conclusive word, 
86|14|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|It is no pleasantry. 
86|15|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|Lo! they plot a plot (against thee, O Muhammad) 
86|16|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|And I plot a plot (against them). 
86|17|at-Tariq: The Night-Comer|So give a respite to the disbelievers. Deal thou gently with them for a while. 
87|1|al-A`la: The Most High|Praise the name of thy Lord the Most High, 
87|2|al-A`la: The Most High|Who createth, then disposeth; 
87|3|al-A`la: The Most High|Who measureth, then guideth; 
87|4|al-A`la: The Most High|Who bringeth forth the pasturage, 
87|5|al-A`la: The Most High|Then turneth it to russet stubble. 
87|6|al-A`la: The Most High|We shall make thee read (O Muhammad) so that thou shalt not forget 
87|7|al-A`la: The Most High|Save that which Allah willeth. Lo! He knoweth the disclosed and that which  still is hidden; 
87|8|al-A`la: The Most High|And We shall ease thy way unto the state of ease. 
87|9|al-A`la: The Most High|Therefor remind (men), for of use is the reminder. 
87|10|al-A`la: The Most High|He will heed who feareth, 
87|11|al-A`la: The Most High|But the most hapless will flout it, 
87|12|al-A`la: The Most High|He who will be flung to the great Fire 
87|13|al-A`la: The Most High|Wherein he will neither die nor live. 
87|14|al-A`la: The Most High|He is successful who groweth, 
87|15|al-A`la: The Most High|And remembereth the name of his Lord, so prayeth, 
87|16|al-A`la: The Most High|But ye prefer the life of the world 
87|17|al-A`la: The Most High|Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting. 
87|18|al-A`la: The Most High|Lo! This is in the former scrolls. 
87|19|al-A`la: The Most High|The Books of Abraham and Moses. 
88|1|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Hath there come unto thee tidings of the Overwhelming ? 
88|2|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|On that day (many) faces will be downcast, 
88|3|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Toiling, weary, 
88|4|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Scorched by burning fire, 
88|5|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Drinking from a boiling spring, 
88|6|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|No food for them save bitter thorn-fruit 
88|7|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Which doth not nourish nor release from hunger. 
88|8|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|In that day other faces will be calm, 
88|9|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Glad for their effort past, 
88|10|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|In a high Garden 
88|11|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Where they hear no idle speech, 
88|12|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Wherein is a gushing spring, 
88|13|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Wherein are couches raised 
88|14|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And goblets set at hand 
88|15|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And cushions ranged 
88|16|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And silken carpets spread. 
88|17|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Will they not regard the camels, how they are created ? 
88|18|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And the heaven, how it is raised ? 
88|19|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And the hills, how they are set up ? 
88|20|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And the earth, how it is spread ? 
88|21|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Remind them, for thou art but a remembrancer, 
88|22|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Thou art not at all a warder over them. 
88|23|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|But whoso is averse and disbelieveth, 
88|24|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Allah will punish him with direst punishment. 
88|25|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|Lo! unto Us is their return 
88|26|al-Ghashiya: The Overwhelming Calamity|And Ours their reckoning. 
89|1|al-Fajr: The Dawn|By the Dawn 
89|2|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And ten nights, 
89|3|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And the Even and the Odd, 
89|4|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And the night when it departeth, 
89|5|al-Fajr: The Dawn|There surely is an oath for thinking man. 
89|6|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt with (the tribe of) A'ad, 
89|7|al-Fajr: The Dawn|With many-columned Iram, 
89|8|al-Fajr: The Dawn|The like of which was not created in the lands; 
89|9|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove the rocks in the valley; 
89|10|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And with Pharaoh, firm of might, 
89|11|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands, 
89|12|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And multiplied iniquity therein ? 
89|13|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment. 
89|14|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful. 
89|15|al-Fajr: The Dawn|As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him by honouring him, and is gracious  unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth me. 
89|16|al-Fajr: The Dawn|But whenever He trieth him by straitening his means of life, he saith: My  Lord despiseth me. 
89|17|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan 
89|18|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And urge not on the feeding of the poor. 
89|19|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And ye devour heritages with devouring greed. 
89|20|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And love wealth with abounding love. 
89|21|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Nay, but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding, 
89|22|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And thy Lord shall come with angels, rank on rank, 
89|23|al-Fajr: The Dawn|And hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but how  will the remembrance (then avail him) ? 
89|24|al-Fajr: The Dawn|He will say: Ah, would that I had sent before me (some provision) for my  life! 
89|25|al-Fajr: The Dawn|None punisheth as He will punish on that day! 
89|26|al-Fajr: The Dawn|None bindeth as He then will bind. 
89|27|al-Fajr: The Dawn|But ah! thou soul at peace! 
89|28|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Return unto thy Lord, content in His good pleasure! 
89|29|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Enter thou among My bondmen! 
89|30|al-Fajr: The Dawn|Enter thou My Garden! 
90|1|al-Balad: The City|Nay, I swear by this city - 
90|2|al-Balad: The City|And thou art an indweller of this city - 
90|3|al-Balad: The City|And the begetter and that which he begat, 
90|4|al-Balad: The City|We verily have created man in an atmosphere: 
90|5|al-Balad: The City|Thinketh he that none hath power over him ? 
90|6|al-Balad: The City|And he saith: I have destroyed vast wealth: 
90|7|al-Balad: The City|Thinketh he that none beholdeth him ? 
90|8|al-Balad: The City|Did We not assign unto him two eyes 
90|9|al-Balad: The City|And a tongue and two lips, 
90|10|al-Balad: The City|And guide him to the parting of the mountain ways ? 
90|11|al-Balad: The City|But he hath not attempted the Ascent - 
90|12|al-Balad: The City|Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Ascent is! - 
90|13|al-Balad: The City|(It is) to free a slave, 
90|14|al-Balad: The City|And to feed in the day of hunger. 
90|15|al-Balad: The City|An orphan near of kin, 
90|16|al-Balad: The City|Or some poor wretch in misery, 
90|17|al-Balad: The City|And to be of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and  exhort one another to pity. 
90|18|al-Balad: The City|Their place will be on the right hand. 
90|19|al-Balad: The City|But those who disbelieve Our revelations, their place will be on the left hand. 
90|20|al-Balad: The City|Fire will be an awning over them.

91|9|ash-Shams: The Sun|He is indeed successful who causeth it to grow, 
91|10|ash-Shams: The Sun|And he is indeed a failure who stunteth it. 
91|11|ash-Shams: The Sun|(The tribe of) Thamud denied (the truth) in their rebellious pride, 
91|12|ash-Shams: The Sun|When the basest of them broke forth 
91|13|ash-Shams: The Sun|And the messenger of Allah said: It is the she-camel of Allah, so let her  drink!

92|10|al-Layl: The Night|Surely We will ease his way unto adversity. 
92|11|al-Layl: The Night|His riches will not save him when he perisheth. 
92|12|al-Layl: The Night|Lo! Ours it is (to give) the guidance

92|21|al-Layl: The Night|He verily will be content.

93|6|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Did He not find thee an orphan and protect (thee) ? 
93|7|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Did He not find thee wandering and direct (thee) ? 
93|8|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee) ? 
93|9|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Therefor the orphan oppress not, 
93|10|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Therefor the beggar drive not away, 
93|11|ad-Duha: The Early Hours|Therefor of the bounty of thy Lord be thy discourse.

98|5|al-Bayyinah: The Proof|And they are ordered naught else than to serve Allah, keeping religion pure  for Him, as men by nature upright, and to establish worship and to pay the poor-due.  That is true religion. 
98|6|al-Bayyinah: The Proof|Lo! those who disbelieve, among the People of the Scripture and the  idolaters, will abide in fire of hell. They are the worst of created beings.
